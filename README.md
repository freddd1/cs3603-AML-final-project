# cs3603-AML-final-project
This repo contains all the code for our final project.
There are 2 notebooks to run.
- `main-msrp.ipynb` - replicate the article results.
- `main-semeval8.ipynb` - implement the article model on new datasets.


## How to run:
- Clone the repo locally, create conda environment using the `environment.yml` and run the project.
- Run this colab notebook (run only semeval8): https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1SM6EnIYHlfkiVfwk8MCw9RzZF8anldPz?usp=sharing


## Environment
We run it locally with Python `3.8.13` and with conda env from `environment.yml` file.
<br>
After configuring the environment, all you need to do is to run the `main.ipynb` notebook. <br> It imports all the necessary code from the `.py` files.
