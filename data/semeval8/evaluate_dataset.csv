SEOUL, Jan. 21 (UPI) -- Lotte Group founder Shin Kyuk-ho has died at age 98, the last first-generation tycoon of South Korea's family-run conglomerates. South Korea's fifth-largest conglomerate said in a statement that its honorary chairman died of a chronic disease about 4:30 p.m. Sunday at Asan Medical Center in Seoul. Advertisement

Born in Ulsan, South Korea, in 1921, Shin moved to Japan alone in 1941 when Korea was under colonial rule.

Shin started his business in 1944 there but his factories burned down during World War II. Then the young entrepreneur launched Lotte in 1948 to churn out soaps, cosmetics, food and beverages.

After Seoul and Tokyo resumed diplomatic relations in 1965, Shin tapped into his home country in the late 1960s.

Shin expanded the business horizon of Lotte to such areas as tourism, retail, petrochemicals and construction. He eventually grew the business into South Korea's No. 5 conglomerate, competing with the likes of Samsung, Hyundai and LG.

In 1995, the Seoul administration recognized his contributions to the tourism industry by awarding him the Gold Tower Order of Industrial Service Merit, the first in the tourism industry.

His later years were plagued by family feuds involving his two sons, who staged legal battles and proxy wars to take control of the business empire.

The high-profile sibling fights took place after Shin left the management while suffering from various diseases, including dementia.

In late 2017, he was sentenced to four years in prison and fined about $3 million on charges of embezzlement and breach of trust. But he was not imprisoned due to deteriorating health conditions.

Besides his sons, Shin is survived by his wife and a daughter. He also maintained a common-law marriage with a former beauty pageant winner with whom he had another daughter.",https://web.archive.org/web/20220102074654id_/https://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2020/01/21/Lotte-Group-founder-dies-at-age-98/1901579633834/,,,['Business']
85,1483909901,,Malaysian Muslim students hold protest against Chinese education group over Jawi writing,en,,,,KUALA LUMPUR - Some 300 Muslim students gathered on Wednesday (Jan 1) to protest against Chinese educationist group Dong Zong for opposing a Malaysian government's plan to introduce Jawi writing in Chinese and Tamil schools.. Read more at straitstimes.com.,"KUALA LUMPUR - Some 300 Muslim students gathered on Wednesday (Jan 1) to protest against Chinese educationist group Dong Zong for opposing a Malaysian government's plan to introduce Jawi writing in Chinese and Tamil schools.

The peaceful gathering, organised by the Malaysian Muslim Students Coalition (Gamis), was held despite a warning by the police on Tuesday (Dec 31) that the organiser failed to obtained a permit from Kuala Lumpur City Hall and the police for the march.

Police did not interfere with the protest held outside a popular mall in downtown Kuala Lumur. The college students held up placards and banners while listening to speeches by several speakers.

One large banner in Jawi, complete with a clenched fist painted in red, read, 'People, rise to defend Jawi'. A placard read: 'Undergraduates rise to defend Jawi'.

Earlier, some 150 students had assembled at the historic Masjid Jamek Kuala Lumpur mosque and were planning to march to the mall nearby. But they were advised against doing so by Gamis president Saifullah Baiduri, MalayMail online news reported, because holding a march without a proper permit is forbidden by a local law.

Ethnic tensions rose last week after Chinese education groups - the United Chinese Schools Teachers' Association (Jiao Zong) and the United Chinese School Committees' Association (Dong Zong) - planned to hold a protest congress against Jawi's introduction.

There are more than 1,200 Chinese and 523 Tamil primary schools in Malaysia that use either Mandarin or Tamil as the medium of instruction.

In August, the ministry surprised most people by saying it would include Jawi writing in the Year 4 (Primary 4) syllabus of Bahasa Melayu in the vernacular schools, raising concerns over creeping Islamisation.

These vernacular schools are run independently of national schools, and where the students, mainly Malays, are taught Jawi writing as part of Islamic studies.

The police obtained a court order to stop the congress planned by the Chinese education groups, but allowed a National Jawi Congress to proceed on Sunday.

The organisers of Sunday's congress that included prominent political activists urged the government to put on hold the teaching of a Jawi calligraphy module in the vernacular schools.",http://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/malaysian-muslim-students-hold-protest-against-chinese-education-group-over-jawi,,,"['ISLAM', 'EDUCATION AND SCHOOLS', 'MALAYSIA']"

With the season heading in a direction that no one saw coming, when should Detroit Pistons fans accept what this team is?

It’s a rather arbitrary thing to even profess but if the Detroit Pistons are going to continue to lose games, at some point should the fans become content with that? With a franchise that for the last decade has had trouble looking ahead to the future and instead focusing all their time on the present, being forced into a rebuild may not be such a bad thing.

After all, it’s overdue. As it stands, the Pistons are currently sitting on a 12-22 record and have lost eight of their last ten games. With the Lakers and Clippers on the horizon within the next three games, in all likelihood that record is going to continue to drop.

With the way this season has gone Detroit has played a majority of these last few months with a heavily depleted roster. Injuries continue to pile up which has played a major role in the woes. The silver lining to this – if one can be found – is that it’s forced some of the Pistons younger players into elevated roles. Svi Mykhaililuk is a prime example, someone who was expected to see some time off of the bench, but was not expected to play 24 minutes per game like he has in his last six outings.

Bruce Brown has been bouncing back in forth between shooting guard and his new role as one of Detroit’s point guards. Doing this has opened up an interesting wrinkle in his versatility and play making ability. His defense is ever improving and even his three-point shot is slowly starting to fall with more consistency.

Prior to his injury even Luke Kennard was beginning to look noticeably more confident with the ball in his hands, and one can assume he’s been given the green light to shoot whenever he feels comfortable. His development is more or less on par with fan expectations, but the others may be slightly quicker than anticipated.

So at some point, evaluating the current field of talent in the league versus what product is currently in Detroit – is it really the worst thing in the world if this team is forced to take a direction that they aren’t comfortable taking? No, it isn’t. Although this upcoming draft class currently feels slightly underwhelming, it’s undoubtedly front loaded with some interesting prospects at the point guard position – something that Detroit would likely utilize with their first round pick.

It’s never going to necessarily be fun watching a team begin to tank, but when it’s inadvertently happening to begin with due to a lack of ability to compete – what’s the difference? If nothing else fans can find solace in the fact that they have a chance to secure a top draft pick. The current front office in Detroit has done a commendable job with their drafting in their short tenure.

At the end of the day regardless of how many injuries are currently effecting the Pistons, it feels as if the decision should be clear to mail it in this season and at the very least – try to re-tool for next season. Blake Griffin‘s window is beginning to close so that doesn’t leave much time to keep messing around.

Detroit needs a fresh start and whether or not they accept it willingly, it may arrive all the same.",https://pistonpowered.com/2019/12/31/detroit-pistons-comfortable-with-losing/,,,['NBA All-Star Weekend']

Byte is hoping to regain the popularity of Vine, which was loved for its rule of only allowing 6-second looping videos.

3 Byte is a new app designed to replace the void left by Vine Credit: Byte

The mind behind Byte is Vine co-founder Dom Hofmann, who has been working on the new app for two years.

Just like Vine, Byte limits videos to six seconds in length – and loops them after they've finished.

""Today we're bringing back 6-second looping videos and a new community for people who love them,"" Byte's creators wrote.

""It's called Byte and it's both familiar and new. We hope it'll resonate with people who feel something's been missing.""

3 Users will be limited to uploading videos no longer than six seconds – which will loop after finishing Credit: Byte

It was originally supposed to launch in spring 2019, but was delayed for unknown reasons.

Now the app is free to download and is available on iPhone and Android phones.

Vine was founded back in June 2012, and was bought up by Twitter in October that same year – in what's believed to have been a $30million (£22.9million) deal.

The app shot to popularity due to its short clips, with successful users often focusing particularly on comedy videos.

It was free to download, and was available on phones, computers and even game consoles.

But on October 27, 2016, Twitter announced that the Vine mobile app would be discontinued.

In December 2016, it was confirmed that the Vine app would remain operational, but videos would be published directly to Twitter.

A month later, Vine's community website was shut down and the app was renamed to Vine Camera – which was largely deemed a flop.

3 Byte was created by Vine co-founder Dom Hoffman Credit: Twitter

In January 2017, Twitter launched an archive of all Vine videos, but there was no way to upload new content to the service.

Many Vine videos still prove popular on YouTube today, and there's been significant interest in a reboot of the app.

But Vine now faces stiff competition from rival app TikTok, a video app that's hugely popular with teens.

Byte – will it be the next hit app? Here's what industry expert Paolo Pescatore, of PP Foresight, told The Sun... ""Video is the next battle ground and is fast becoming a crowded place with too many services chasing few dollars.

""There are some opportunities to be novel that will resonate with viewers.

""Everyone wants to jump on the new thing but making money and attracting top quality content will represent the biggest test.

""For now new services need to have eyeballs and content.""

Former Vine celebrities who have since transferred to TikTok are already turning up on Byte too.

They include Lance Stewart, Chris Melberger and Josh Darnit.

These online stars are likely attracted by the fact that Byte has vowed to start paying creators immediately – despite having only just launched.

154,1619642001,,"Hey Twitter: If You’re Going to Fact-Check, Get Your Facts Straight",en,,,,,"On Tuesday, President Donald Trump went off on the Democrats and their attempts to turn the 2020 election into an all-mail-in affair, complete with all of the opportunities fraudsters needs to tilt the results any way they might choose.

“There is NO WAY (ZERO!) that Mail-In Ballots will be anything less than substantially fraudulent,” tweeted the president. “Mail boxes will be robbed, ballots will be forged & even illegally printed out & fraudulently signed.”

Instead of giving Trump space to air his opinions and predictions about this scheme, Twitter took it upon themselves to throw their objectivity away and slap a “fact check” label on the tweet. This label linked to a paragraph assuring users that there was “no evidence” of widespread fraud connected to mail-in voting, all but suggesting that the president is lying to the American people.

Predictably, this raised Trump’s ire. “@Twitter is now interfering in the 2020 Presidential Election. They are saying my statement on Mail-In Ballots, which will lead to massive corruption and fraud, is incorrect, based on fact-checking by Fake News CNN and the Amazon Washington Post.”

In addition to sticking their noses in where they aren’t wanted and don’t belong, Twitter actually made a fool of themselves by trying to “fact check” the president.

First of all, since this is the first tweet that they’ve done this to, we assume that every single thing that Trump has written up till this Tuesday is 100% true. That certainly goes against what his critics in the mainstream media have been saying for the last four years.

Second, Twitter is endangering their status as a “platform,” which gives them all kinds of liability protections that would not be available to them if they were deemed a “publisher.” Right now, Twitter is exempt from defamation and libel lawsuits based on what people on their platform say. They aren’t responsible for what’s written there. But if they’re going to wade into the fray and start labeling posts true and false, then that may change in a hurry.

Finally, if Twitter is going to fact-check the President of the United States, they should probably make sure they have their facts straight. In 2005, a bipartisan Commission on Federal Election Reform found that “absentee ballots remain the largest source of potential voter fraud” in the United States. Just this week, in fact, the Alabama secretary of State confirmed that 83% of the voter fraud his state has seen in the last five years has come from mail-in ballots.

Maybe it’s too much to ask that Twitter fact-check their fact-checks. And, to be clear, we’re actually NOT asking them to do so. We’d much prefer they go back to minding their own business and letting people do their own research. But if they want to take on this burden, they need to be prepared. So far, they’ve only succeeded in embarrassing themselves.",https://web.archive.org/web/20210802182559id_/https://patriotnewsdaily.com/hey-twitter-if-youre-going-to-fact-check-get-your-facts-straight/,,,

168,1489334002,,李心洁卖力催《夕雾》 “一定要看很多次”,en,,,,,"《夕雾花园》中“张云林”这个角色，对于李心洁来说非常具挑战。

在世界各地播映之后都获得了极佳回响的电影《夕雾花园》，女主角李心洁坦言，拍摄这部电影可说是她面对精神与体力的极大挑战。

《夕雾花园》由台湾导演林书宇操刀，改编自马来西亚作家陈团英的同名小说。故事描述李心洁所饰演的“张云林”，与阿部宽所饰演的日本园艺师在二战后的揪心爱情故事。这次李心洁联同张艾嘉以及林书宇来马宣传《夕雾花园》，3人在周四记者会前预先与大马媒体小聚。

李心洁说，在电影里面所饰演的张云林是一个挺复杂的角色，“她的生命里经历了很多，这是我的生命不可能会经历的，所以为了把角色演好，我参考了很多那个年代的故事，我不顾一切百分百的投入进‘云林’的世界，由于需要拿捏的细节很多，让我消耗太多，所以拍摄的每一天都很累。”

李心洁为了揣摩好这个角色，看完剧本后在恩师张艾嘉的提点下很用心的把原著看完，然后再与导演讨论细节，一点都不马虎。“开始前我做了很多功课走近‘她’，电影杀青后我的确花了很长的时间才能慢慢离开‘她’。”电影杀青后有次参与禅修时，突然一股愤怒的情绪油然而生，原来是最后一幕戏负面能量的情绪得到了宣泄。

李心洁坦言《夕雾花园》看了3次，每次与不同的人，但是3次看都感动到流泪。第一次与导演在釜山影展的时候看，看得很紧张也觉得自己看得很不理智，因为带着自我审核的心情，批判自己演得不好的地方，也看那些地方被减掉了，非常的不享受。

“第2次看到了很多的细节，不同演员的演出；第3次看到更多的东西，所以我告诉大家这部电影一定要看很多次，越看越好看，我接下来还会看个4、5、6次。”

张艾嘉尝试拍VR

对于这次接演《夕雾花园》，张艾嘉饰演年老的李心洁，她笑言：“如果不由我演，我没办法接受其他人演心洁老的时候。”

张艾嘉早前宣布不再参选金马奖，这次来马为《夕雾花园》宣传时向媒体表示，自己在这个行业这么久了，奖项已经不是她的目标，希望把更多机会留给年轻人。她说，近两年都与很多不同国家的新导演合作，接下来还有意尝试拍摄VR电影，对她来说是一个非常大的挑战。

林书宇大马版“加料”

至于导演林书宇坦言，大马版的《夕雾花园》被剪了一刀以及一些修改的部分，但是并不影响电影张力，也不会让观众看不懂。他和剪接师讨论过在大马版的部分有加了一些片段，这些是海外版没有的。

他说，之前都是在台湾拍电影，自从执导了《夕雾花园》这部跨国的作品后，他发现自己真的变勇敢了。“这次一个人来到马来西亚，与一群从未合作的团队合作，原来并没有想象中的困难。下次有其他国家的邀约都不担心了。”",https://web.archive.org/web/20200109144537id_/https://eunited.com.my/334927/,,,

Hanks, 63, took to Twitter Sunday to announce that self-quarantining has worked in keeping him and Wilson safe. Shielding themselves from others has protected their friends, family, and general public.

“Hey, folks. Two weeks after our first symptoms and we feel better,” Hanks tweeted.

“Sheltering in place works like this: You don’t give it to anyone – You don’t get it from anyone. Common sense, no? Going to take awhile, but if we take care of each other, help where we can, and give up some comforts… this, too, shall pass. We can figure it out. Hanx.”

The couple came forward on March 11 to say they were experiencing the symptoms of COVID-19. After they tested positive, they were quarantined at a Queensland hospital and then sent back to spend the remainder of their quarantine at their Australia home.

The pair are in Australia because Hanks is working on an Elvis Presley film.

Hanks and Wilson were among the first celebrities to acknowledge publicly that they had the disease. Since then, several other actors, athletes, and high-profile politicians have come forward to confirm they tested positive.

236,1484084603,,Thanos' Defeat Leaves The Door Open For Bigger MCU Villains,en,,,,"Thanos was defeated in Avengers: Endgame, the Infinity Saga finale, so the MCU phase 4 will introduce the next big Marvel villains.","Thanos was finally dispatched (twice!) over the course of Avengers: Endgame, leaving long-time fans of the Marvel Cinematic Universe pondering how future films in this series would fill the antagonist role he occupied. Thanos' defeat leaves the door open for another big Marvel villain to take his place; however, this formidable character is an enormously difficult act to follow. Thanos had been set up for six years as the primary foe of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, ever since he turned around to deliver a grin during the credits of the first Avengers. Since then, his powerful nature in-universe had been made abundantly clear, especially after he actually pulled off his evil plan at the end of Avengers: Infinity War.

Continue scrolling to keep reading Click the button below to start this article in quick view.

After all of that hype and subsequent mayhem caused by Thanos, how exactly can the MCU deliver future villains that can measure up to this iconic foe? Well, the very defeat of that character could help open up the door for subsequent powerful adversaries to emerge over future Marvel Cinematic Universe titles. Considering things from the perspective of in-universe supervillains, a powerful figure like Thanos being completely off the table now leaves an opening for new foes to take his place. Nefarious individuals previously petrified to deal with Thanos and his gauntlet now have their chance to step out of the shadows and conquer the world.

The writers crafting the next wave of MCU storylines need to look at Thanos as a figure whose power kept equally formidable antagonists at bay. His defeat has left a power vacuum in the universe. Dormammu, The Mandarin, and even Doctor Doom (who Marvel again has the film rights to), can all now step-up to the plate as towering villainous forces because they don't have to contend with Thanos and all of his might. Marvel superheroes like Thor couldn't have been the only ones intimidated by Thanos — whose to say previously-unseen supervillains weren't also terrified of this purple beast?

MCU Villains That Could Follow Thanos

Of course, such fear has now been removed from the hearts of supervillains all across the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The Avengers taking out Thanos took out one threat, but it's easy to see that victory opening up the door for a whole avalanche of new threats to emerge. One could easily see Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness featuring a version of Dormammu that, in the wake of Thanos being defeated, sees a chance for himself to garner heretofore unknown levels of power. Similarly, there's a whole slew of powerful villains whose film rights were previously owned exclusively by 20th Century Fox, such as the Fantastic Four property, that could emerge in the wake of Thanos' demise.

Wouldn't it be a logical extension of Thanos being taken down for Galactus, now having to face one less challenger, to emerge as a multi-film baddie whose power dwarfs even those utilized by Thanos? The sheer power possessed by Thanos, as well as his pop-culture ubiquity, puts a great level of pressure on those tasked with creating future powerful villains for members of the Marvel Cinematic Universe to face. But every ending is somebody else's beginning, and it's easy to see an outcome where the demise of Thanos at the end of Avengers: Endgame is an impetus for even greater supervillains to follow.

275,1581599703,['Social Links For Vincent Barone'],Antibody study suggests coronavirus rate much higher than previously believed,en,,,,A recent study found that between 2.5 and 4 percent of participants had the antibodies that show they've recovered from COVID-19.,"Sign up for our special edition newsletter to get a daily update on the coronavirus pandemic.

Many more people may have been infected by the coronavirus than previously believed, a new study shows.

A recent study tested the blood of 3,300 volunteers in Santa Clara County, Calif., and found that between 2.5 and 4 percent of them had the antibodies that show they’ve recovered from COVID-19.

In a county the size of Santa Clara, where the population numbers 2 million, that rate of infection would mean between 48,000 and 81,000 people have fought off the virus — far more than the 1,000 who have officially tested positive there.

“Our findings suggest that there is somewhere between 50- and 80-fold more infections in our county than what’s known by the number of cases than are reported by our department of public health,” Dr. Eran Bendavid, the associate professor of medicine at Stanford University who led the study, said in an interview with ABC News.

Antibody blood tests, also known as serology tests, analyze blood from a finger prick. The process differs from coronavirus tests that swab the nose and throat.

The results, while limited, back a popular belief among health experts that significantly more people have been infected than testing shows — due to some people being asymptomatic and to the country’s limited testing capacity.

Dr. John Brownstein, an epidemiologist and ABC News contributor, cautioned that the results for the California county are not necessarily representative of the country’s population — but he said the study is “adding to this confirmation of what we’ve expected, which is a much larger number of cases than we ever anticipated.”

A sweeping COVID-19 testing initiative on the Navy’s coronavirus-stricken aircraft carrier, the USS Theodore Roosevelt, found that 60 percent of its sailors who tested positive were asymptomatic.

But the link between a positive coronavirus antibody test and immunity is not yet clear.

The World Health Organization cautioned Friday that it’s not yet known whether having survived the deadly virus brings a universal immunity to reinfection.

“These antibody tests will be able to measure that level of serology presence, that level of antibodies, but that does not mean that somebody with antibodies” is immune, said Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, the head of the WHO’s emerging diseases unit.",https://nypost.com/2020/04/17/more-have-been-infected-with-coronavirus-than-believed-study/,,,"['california', 'Coronavirus']"

Chancellor Angela Merkel is set to consider a possible rescue package for Lufthansa during talks with senior politicians and the troubled airline’s chief executive next week, DPA learned on Saturday.

As the airline struggles with the fallout from cancellations caused by the coronavirus pandemic, Merkel plans to meet with Finance Minister Olaf Scholz, Economy Minister Peter Altmaier, Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer and Lufthansa’s chief executive, Carsten Spohr.

The government is said to be mulling a rescue package worth between 9 billion and 10 billion euros (9.7 billion and 10.8 billion dollars) according to sources close to the government.

There is disagreement, however, about what form such assistance should take and about the degree of any temporary government nationalization of the airline.

Apparently some are reluctant to add additional yet more government oversight to the company, with some sources worrying that would add to the problems the company already faces.

The airline has been severely impacted by the pandemic and Spohr has already told employees to prepare for difficult times ahead.

316,1483950504,,PM told: ‘Treat $2bn insurers with respect’,en,,,,Bahamian insurers yesterday urged the prime minister to “treat the industry with the respect it deserves” over its $2bn Dorian-related payout after he suggested it was “holding back” recovery efforts.,"By NEIL HARTNELL

Tribune Business Editor

nhartnell@tribunemedia.net

Bahamian insurers yesterday urged the prime minister to “treat the industry with the respect it deserves” over its $2bn Dorian-related payout after he suggested it was “holding back” recovery efforts.

Anton Saunders, RoyalStar Assurance’s managing director, told Tribune Business that Dr Hubert Minnis and his officials knew where to reach the Bahamas Insurance Association (BIA) and the industry’s “major players” if they had any issues with their role following the category five storm.

Responding after the prime minister was reported to have said that demolition of unsafe buildings on Abaco and Grand Bahama is being delayed while the insurance companies complete their claims assessments, Mr Saunders reiterated that the extent of Dorian’s devastation was bound to make this process take slightly longer than in previous storms.

He also pointed out that the industry, and its loss adjusters, had been denied access to the worst-hit parts of Abaco for the immediate fortnight post-Dorian by the government as it sought to make the area safe.

“If the prime minister has information, he or his representatives should come to the BIA, call us to a meeting and discuss it,” Mr Saunders told Tribune Business. “I don’t know where he’s getting his information from.

“If you have an organisation that’s spent $2bn, somebody needs to pick up the phone. The prime minister knows all the big players in the insurance industry; if he has legitimate concerns with the insurance industry he’s the prime minister. He can summon us to a meeting and cure all this upset.”

Dr Minnis had suggested, according to media reports, that the post-Dorian reconstruction and recovery effort was being “held back” because the insurance companies were still completing their claims adjusting work.

“The insurance companies have not yet completed their job in terms of assessing and compensating individuals,” the prime minister said on Christmas Day. “So we are held back to some extent even by insurance companies... We cannot move buildings until they have been assessed by the insurance companies.”

Asked subsequently for clarification, Dr Minnis said: “One of the challenges we have with Abaco is you cannot do much, not even within the yards. You have to wait for clearance by the insurance companies - those who have insurance - because if you were to demolish them then insurance companies can always argue that the building was not as bad as said. So you have to work hand in hand with them.”

Bahamian property and casualty insurers earlier this month told Tribune Business that the industry’s total Dorian claims payouts are now estimated to come in at the upper end of the last $1.5bn to $2bn estimate, making the storm comfortably the largest ever loss event suffered by the sector and its reinsurance partners in this nation.

Mr Saunders yesterday said he wanted to avoid getting into any ‘blame game’ or finger-pointing in relation to the Prime Minister’s comments, but revealed that he “just laughed” when he saw them in the newspaper.

“Treat the insurance industry with the respect it deserves and call a meeting,” the RoyalStar chief told Tribune Business. “We’re all big boys. The industry didn’t even get access to Abaco for the first two weeks because the Government, rightfully so, said they didn’t want us there until they did what they had to do.

“If the Prime Minister has a problem with the insurance industry he has all the resources to call a meeting with all its executives, some of whom he knows personally, and ask us what the hell is going on.”

Sir Franklyn Wilson, RoyalStar Assurance’s chairman, told Tribune Business he, too, was unsure what the Prime Minister meant by his remarks that the insurance industry’s processes were “holding back” post-Dorian reconstruction.

“I see the Prime Minister making comments that the insurance industry is slow, but in the case of RoyalStar where I am chairman we’ve done yeoman’s work. I don’t know what the Prime Minister is alluding to, but most of our adjusters were set to go home before Christmas because their work, their task was effectively done,” Sir Franklyn added yesterday.

Mr Saunders had earlier this month told Tribune Business that RoyalStar had settled around 80 percent of its roughly 1,800 Dorian claims, while his Bahamas First counterpart, Patrick Ward, had revealed that 50 percent of its 2,000 claims had been paid out and agreed.

“The industry has proven its weight and value,” Mr Saunders said then, “and doesn’t get as much credit as it deserves for being an economic stabilising force in The Bahamas. Imagine if the insurance industry was not here. Who else is going to pay that additional $2bn.

“Every claim we are responsible for internally, all of our reinsurers, all of our network partners, we have a gross reserve of $325m. All in we have a total of 1,800 claims, and of those 1,800 claims we have satisfied and settled 80 percent of those. We’re slightly ahead of expected pace.”",http://tribune242.com/news/2019/dec/31/pm-told-treat-2bn-insurers-respect/,,,
317,1484013404,['The Conversation'],Hangovers happen as your body tries to protect itself from alcohol’s toxic effects,en,,,,A night of revelry can mean an uncomfortable day after.,"Debaucherous evening last night? You’re probably dealing with veisalgia right now.

More commonly known as a hangover, this unpleasant phenomenon has been dogging humanity since our ancestors first happened upon fermentation.

Those nasty vertigo-inducing, cold sweat-promoting and vomit-producing sensations after a raucous night out are all part of your body’s attempt to protect itself from injury after you overindulge in alcoholic beverages. Your liver is working to break down the alcohol you consumed so your kidneys can clear it out ASAP. But in the process, your body’s inflammatory and metabolic reactions are going to lay you low with a hangover.

Advertisement:

As long as people have suffered from hangovers, they’ve searched in vain for a cure. Revelers have access to a variety of compounds, products and devices that purport to ease the pain. But there’s a lot of purporting and not a lot of proof. Most have not been backed up well by science in terms of usefulness for hangover treatment, and often their effects don’t seem like they’d match up with what scientists know about the biology of the hangover.

Working overtime to clear out the booze

Hangovers are virtually guaranteed when you drink too much. That amount varies from person to person based on genetic factors as well as whether there are other compounds that formed along with ethanol in the fermentation process.

Over the course of a night of heavy drinking, your blood alcohol level continues to rise. Your body labors to break down the alcohol — consumed as ethanol in beer, wine or spirits — forming damaging oxygen free radicals and acetaldehyde, itself a harmful compound. The longer ethanol and acetaldehyde stick around, the more damage they can do to your cellular membranes, proteins and DNA, so your body’s enzymes work quickly to metabolize acetaldehyde to a less toxic compound, acetate.

Over time, your ethanol levels drop through this natural metabolic process. Depending on how much you consumed, you’re likely to experience a hangover as the level of ethanol in your blood slowly returns to zero. Your body is withdrawing from high levels of circulating alcohol, while at the same time trying to protect itself from the effects of alcohol.

Scientists have limited knowledge of the leading causes of the hangover. But they do know that the body’s responses include changes in hormone levels to reduce dehydration and cellular stress. Alcohol consumption also affects a variety of neurotransmitter systems in the brain, including glutamate, dopamine and serotonin. Inflammation increases in the body’s tissues, and the healthy gut bacteria in your digestive system take a hit too, promoting leaky gut.

Advertisement:

Altogether, the combination of all these reactions and protective mechanisms activated by your system gives rise to the experience of a hangover, which can last up to 48 hours.

Your misery likely has company

Drinking and socializing are cultural acts, and most hangovers do not happen in isolation. Human beings are social creatures, and there’s a high likelihood that at least one other individual feels the same as you the morning after the night before.

Advertisement:

Each society has different rules regarding alcohol use, which can affect how people view alcohol consumption within those cultures. Drinking is often valued for its relaxing effect and for promoting sociability. So it’s common to see alcohol provided at celebratory events, social gatherings and holiday parties.

In the United States, drinking alcohol is largely embraced by mainstream culture, which may even promote behaviors involving excessive drinking. It should be no surprise that overindulgence goes hand in hand with these celebratory social events — and leads to hangover regrets a few hours later.

Your body’s reactions to high alcohol intake and the sobering-up period can influence mood, too. The combination of fatigue that you experience from sleep deprivation and hormonal stress reactions, in turn, affect your neurobiological responses and behavior. As your body is attempting to repair itself, you’re more likely to be easily irritated, exhausted and want nothing more than to be left alone. Of course, your work productivity takes a dramatic hit the day after an evening of heavy drinking.

Advertisement:

When all is said and done, you’re the cause of your own hangover pain, and you’re the one who must pay for all the fun of the night before. But in short order, you’ll forget how excruciating your last hangover was. And you may very soon talk yourself into doing the things you swore you’d never do again.

Speeding up recovery

While pharmacologists like us understand a bit about how hangovers work, we still lack a true remedy.

Advertisement:

Countless articles describe a variety of foods, caffeine, ion replenishment, energy drinks, herbal supplements including thyme and ginger, vitamins and the “hair of the dog” as ways to prevent and treat hangovers. But the evidence isn’t really there that any of these work effectively. They’re just not scientifically validated or well reproduced.

For example, Kudzu root (Pueraria lobata), a popular choice for hangover remedies, has primarily been investigated for its effects in reducing alcohol-mediated stress and hangover. But at the same time, Kudzu root appears to inhibit the enzymes that break down acetaldehyde — not good news since you want to clear that acetaldehyde from your system quickly.

To fill this knowledge gap, our lab is working with colleagues to see if we can find scientific evidence for or against potential hangover remedies. We’ve focused on the benefits of dihydromyricetin, a Chinese herbal medicine that is currently available and formulated as a dietary supplement for hangover reduction or prevention.

Dihydromyricetin appears to work its magic by enhancing alcohol metabolism and reducing its toxic byproduct, acetaldehyde. From our findings in mice models, we are collecting data that support the usefulness of dihydromyricetin in increasing the expression and activity of enzymes responsible for ethanol and acetaldehyde metabolism in the liver, where ethanol is primarily broken down. These findings explain one of the several ways dihydromyricetin protects the body against alcohol stress and hangover symptoms.

Advertisement:

We are also studying how this enhancement of alcohol metabolism results in changes in alcohol drinking behaviors. Previously, dihydromyricetin was found to counteract the relaxation affect of drinking alcohol by interfering with particular neuroreceptors in the brain; rodents didn’t become as intoxicated and consequently reduced their ethanol intake. Through this combination of mechanisms, we hope to illustrate how DHM might reduce the downsides of excessive drinking beyond the temporary hangover, and potentially reduce drinking behavior and damage associated with heavy alcohol consumption.

Of course, limiting alcohol intake and substituting water for many of those drinks during an evening out is probably the best method to avoid a painful hangover. However, for those times when one alcoholic beverage leads to more than a few more, be sure to stay hydrated and catch up on rest. Your best bet for a smoother recovery is probably some combination of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug like ibuprofen, Netflix and a little downtime.

“In the first hour, I was like, ‘Oh, this is going to get 100 likes and I’m going to be really proud of myself for tweeting out a stupid thing,’” Mr. Bondarchuk said later. “And then it just kept coming.”

By morning, the tweet had 4,000 likes. When Mr. Bondarchuk took his lunch break that day, it had 100,000. Soon, the tweet was getting 10,000 or 15,000 new responses every minute, so many notifications his phone kept shutting off.

People variously called him “a Real American Hero” (he’s Canadian), “the extra nugget angel,” “the hero we honestly didn’t deserve,” “Mr. Extra Nugget Giving Man,” “St. Nuggets,” and, the moniker that appears to have stuck: “The Robin Hood of Nuggets.” (Or, less formally, “The Robin Hood of Nugz.”)

There were those who blessed him, wished him good karma, thanked him for his service and told him he’d restored their faith in humanity. As Twitter user @of_obvious wrote, about the experience of unexpectedly receiving 12 McNuggets in a 10-piece order, “It’s amazing how much of a gift that feels like.”

The tweet also prompted others to share their own random acts of fast-food philanthropy, from a Burger King employee who tucks onion rings at the bottom of fry boxes, to workers putting extra cheese on tacos, extra pepperoni on pizza, extra bacon on Baconators.

There was every imaginable meme for “hero” or “gratitude,” and an oft-repeated reminder that “not all heroes wear capes.”

The story of the viral tweet was picked up by news organizations around the world, including the New York Post, Today and Fox News, which speculated Mr. Bondarchuk “may have just become the most popular person on the internet.”

The tweet was liked by billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk, then just days away from the launch of his controversial Cybertruck, and read aloud by Tom Hanks, just days after the release of his movie about Mr. Rogers, in a video celebrating “some of the nicest tweets on the Internet.”

“That is a man who is not only being nice, but he’s feeding the world a little bit better and bucking the corporate strategy,” Mr. Hanks said after reading the tweet. “Bravo. That’s a nice thing to do.”

Others weren’t so charitable. No small number of people called Mr. Bondarchuk a thief and questioned what would happen if every employee did what he had done.

As @DaianaT1 noted, “That’s basically stealing, the nuggets weren’t yours so it’s not up to you deciding how many to put.”

Asked by @North_Resists if there is a “statute of limitations on grand-theft-nuggets,” Mr. Bondarchuk replied, “I hope so because I calculated it and I would owe Ronald about $1,600.”

Others called Mr. Bondarchuk a socialist, a communist, an anarchist and a rebel (either compliments or insults, depending on the tweeter), and a small collection of truthers questioned whether he really gave away any extra nuggets at all.

Appearing on a radio show in Toronto, Mr. Bondarchuk found himself paired with a former McDonald’s franchise owner who was adamant he should be arrested.

But while Mr. Bondarchuk notes he was 14 to 16 years old at the time of the McNugget activity and wouldn’t do it now, he also isn’t apologetic about randomly redistributing pieces of corporate poulet to the populus.

“Wealth inequality is not getting any smaller and it just baffles me that people could look at this and find fault with it,” he says.

For the moment, the viral tweet has levelled off at about 15,000 comments, 81,000 retweets and upward of one-million likes. Mr. Bondarchuk’s followers on Twitter jumped to about 7,000 from 900, which he says has brought both additional expectation and scrutiny.

Story continues below advertisement

For now, Mr. Bondarchuk is using the moment to promote his podcast, Heart Half Full, and also hopes it could help his planned run for Edmonton city council in 2021.

“It certainly gave me like a bit of a perspective into what exactly it means to suddenly be in the spotlight in a very big way,” he said. “I thought I loved attention, but even this was a limit for me.”

“I feel immense sorrow for the family of this child. This is a tragic reminder of how serious the flu can be for both children and adults,’’ said Public Health Commissioner Dr. Monica Bharel in a statement.

“Every flu season is different, but January and February are typically the height of flu season. We want people to know that it’s not too late to get a flu shot,” said Bharel.

The child tested positive for influenza B, a common type of flu in pediatric patients.

This season, between 2,000 to 3,000 Massachusetts residents have been hospitalized with the flu, and there have been 15,000 to 20,000 emergency room visits, according to DPH.

Last flu season, there were four confirmed pediatric flu-related deaths in Massachusetts. As of Jan. 11, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported a total of 39 pediatric flu deaths this season across the nation.

“Flu vaccination is our best protection against illness,” said Dr. Larry Madoff, medical director of the Bureau of Infectious Disease and Laboratory Sciences. “People also should remember to wash their hands, cover their cough and sneeze, and stay home when they are sick to limit the spread of disease.”

Babies, the elderly and those with chronic illness are most susceptible to the flu and flu-related complications.

The most common symptoms are fever, cough, sore throat, body aches, headache, chills, runny nose and fatigue.

The flu vaccine is still available and it is not too late to get vaccinated as the flu season will continue to run for many more weeks.",https://www.bostonherald.com/2020/01/23/first-flu-death-in-worcester-county-teenager-state-health-officials-report/,,,"['Worcester', 'Department of Public Health', 'Flu Season']"

过去数十年，美国、欧洲和日本的车厂都投资巨额于中国开设工厂，而中国亦是全球最大的汽车销售巿场。武汉肺炎爆发，工厂持续停工影响全球汽车供应，亦可能令汽车销量长期下跌。

德国福士汽车和戴姆勒汽车、美国通用汽车、法国雷诺汽车、日本本田汽车和南韩现代汽车都有在中国大量投资，与当地公司合作设厂，而中国多地的工厂上月因农历新年假期关闭时，供应上已承受压力，加上中国过去2年经济放缓，当局估计因爆发武汉肺炎，经济停滞将持续至第3年。

据指，武汉和湖北省其他地区占中国汽车产量9%，中国政府为控制疫情要求车厂停工。法国标致汽车的母公司PSA集团本周指，武汉工厂须至少关闭至下周五（14日），但该公司称其欧洲营运尚未受到任何零件或物流中断影响。通用汽车行政总裁巴拉周三（5日）称公司正与中国合作的公司和当地卫生部门合作，确保供应不会停止。

丰田汽车有15%的汽车于中国厂房生产，对情况感担忧。丰田管理层曾表示，希望下周一（10日）重启中国生产线，但目前厂房应要多关闭一周。其他车厂正评估疫情影响，尽量将损失减到最低。",https://eunited.com.my/350402/,,,

And, to make it worse, Autoclerk was also used for U.S. government travel. So terrorists could have tracked the movements of strategic staff.

Here we go again. In today’s SB Blogwatch, we déjà vu anew.

Your humble blogwatcher curated these bloggy bits for your entertainment. Not to mention: Rollin’.

AWS Data Lake Leak

What’s the craic? Charlie Osborne reports—“Database leaked 179GB in customer, US government, and military records”:

An open database exposing records containing the sensitive data of hotel customers as well as US military personnel and officials has been disclosed. … Autoclerk, a service owned by Best Western Hotels and Resorts group … is a reservations management system used by resorts to manage web bookings, revenue, loyalty programs, guest profiles, and payment processing.

…

It had no encryption or security barriers whatsoever. … Hundreds of thousands of booking reservations for guests were available to view … including full names, dates of birth, home addresses, phone numbers, dates and travel costs, some check-in times and room numbers.

…

It appears that one of the platforms connected to Autoclerk exposed in the breach is a contractor of the US government that deals with travel arrangements. … Within the records, for example, were logs for US Army generals visiting Russia and Israel, among other countries.

…

The United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (CERT) was informed of the leak on September 13 but did not respond.

Ouch. Lindsey O’Donnell adds—“Data Leaked By Autoclerk”:

Autoclerk … was acquired by the Best Western Hotel and Resorts Group in August. … Autoclerk software is used by third-party travel agencies [including] HAPI Cloud, OpenTravel and Synxis by Sabre Hospitality Solutions.

…

Beyond the privacy implications of hackers getting their hands on PII of customers, researchers said that the reservation details of customers in the database could provide attackers with valuable clues to piece together fraud or phishing attacks. … The database could also have physically dangerous implications for victims … especially for potentially high-profile government or military personnel.

Who found it? vpnMentor’s Noam Rotem and Ran Locar—“Travel Reservations Platform Leaks”:

The leak exposed sensitive personal data of users and hotel guests, along with a complete overview of their hotel and travel reservations … with millions of new records being added daily. … This represented a massive breach of security for the government agencies and departments impacted.

…

We have contacted the United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (CERT). We outlined the nature of the leak, and the government, military, and DHS data that was exposed. However, at the time of publishing, they have not replied to our email, ignoring our concerns.

…

All this information is incredibly valuable for criminal hackers and online thieves. … For the US government, alarm bells should be ringing. … Criminals could pose as hotels or booking engines used by guests, crafting convincing emails to easily fool them. The effects could be devastating, both financially and personally.

…

This represents a major flaw in the data security apparatus around such sensitive information. Any company concerned with the travel logistics of high-level military personnel should be adhering to the strictest data protection practices.

Ain’t that the truth? e-sushi—@originalesushi—feels the shockwave:

You’ve probably seen it in the movies: that short, silent moment between the detonation of a nuke, and the blast that sets in to wipe you off this planet.



That’s how job security must feel when you were in charge of the security of that 179GB database.

Time to prosecute the CEO? rtb61 curbs your enthusiasm:

Ahh padawan I see you do not understand, here is the lesson: lowest tender vs. safety and security. When you do it as cheap as you can, do not expect good outcomes—they will not happen.

…

Profit was the primary focus and costs are the enemy of profit, the blood enemy, the enemy to be ruthlessly, relentless attacked. And of course, the **** up turned into someone else’s problem after you have wandered off with the profits and bonuses.

…

[But] expect pretty rapid change after a CEO, board members and tech staff, receive years long custodial sentences. … You don’t think they would ever give a **** about actual security do you? Only if there is a profit in it.

…

The system has been ****ed by psychopaths and will routinely fail.

A slightly less sweary Dean of Pentacles—@da_terry—gets all wistful:

Remember the 90s, when things needed to be hacked? Today, everything is just laying around on the internet.

I know, right? Marlin Schwanke asks, “Why Even Bother Reporting Breaches?”:

Why even bother to report this stuff anymore? We should all assume that every bit of our personal information is freely available online and get over it. The way business runs their IT it doesn’t seem far off the mark.



Business that amass and store consumer data in such a sloppy fashion should be shuttered. I won’t be holding my breath.

And Doctor Syntax is IN:

You’d think by now that hotel chains would have learned that

(a) they really need to do a thorough annual audit of their own security, and

(b) do the same in spades for any business they’re thinking of buying.

…

It’s going to take a few more big fines and lawsuits, big enough for the board and investors to notice. Even then it seems doubtful that they’ll manage to learn from the misfortunes of others.

Meanwhile, Volatile_Memory randomly remembers:

I stayed at a Best Western in Georgia (US) once and they had the username and password for their reservation system written on a note taped next to the computer. I told them about it and … was met with a bored stare.

And Finally:

This is how we roll

A jury for a Derby murder trial has now been sworn in.

Three men from the city are accused of killing 57-year-old Simon Jones.

John Williams, Kirk Guy and Jacob Ali have all previously pleaded not guilty to murdering the former RAF man, of Belper, who died after being stabbed close to Chaddesden Park.

They also deny conspiracy to commit robbery.

His son daughter and son-in-law were all at Derby Crown Court to see the jury members be sworn in.

Sat across from them in court room four were family and friends of the three defendants, who are all in custody.

Guy, 34, of Haydn Road, Derby; Williams, 24, of Waterford Drive, Chaddesden, and Ali, 20, of Ashworth Avenue, Derby, also in Chaddesden, were all smartly dressed in suits for the swearing in of the jury.

Mr Jones, a grandfather-of-three, was found injured in a car park in Chaddesden just before 10pm on Saturday April 20.

He was taken to hospital but later died.

His family have previously described him as “a true gentleman who was adored by everyone”.

Peter Joyce QC, prosecuting, is expected to open the trial on Thursday.

496,1533370906,"['Author', 'Enrique Moreno Gimeranez']","Cuba maintains valuable relations with its citizens living abroad, despite U.S. government hostility",en,,,,Órgano oficial del Comité Central del Partido Comunista de Cuba,"Photo: Cubaminrex

""The strengthening of Cuba's ties with its citizens abroad is a continuous, irreversible and permanent process,"" Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodríguez Parrilla recently posted on his Twitter account.

The celebration in Havana of the Fourth Conference on Nation and Emigration, April 8-10, is another expression of the unequivocal intention of the Cuban government to continue deepening relations with the émigré community, an important pillar in defense of the Homeland, our culture, history and values. This meeting will bring together Cubans who respect and love their country, defend it freely and independently, and actively oppose the blockade imposed by the United States government.

In this regard, the recent visit of Cuban consular officials to Miami and Consul General Alejandro Padrón’s meetings with Cuban-Americans in this city, represented a ""propitious occasion to reiterate the convening of the Fourth Conference on Nation and Emigration, which will reaffirm the important role of our citizens abroad in defense of Cuba,"" according to a tweet from our country's Consulate in the United States.

Cuban diplomats also met with members of the Alianza Martiana coalition and of the Foundation for the Normalization of the Relations between the United States and Cuba (Fornorm), according to information provided to the media.

Measures adopted by the administration of President Donald Trump significantly affect the Cuban community living in the U.S. and disrupt family relations, especially those related to travel restrictions, limitations on consular services, a reduction of allowed remittances and the elimination of commercial and charter flights to Cuban provinces - with flights now available only to Havana's José Martí International Airport.

According to statements by Ernesto Soberón Guzmán, director general of Consular Affairs and Cuban Residents Abroad at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Minrex), ""The majority of the Cuban community in the U.S. rejects the aggressive policy toward Cuba of President Trump's administration and supports the end of the blockade. This confrontational policy is only favored by a minority, the extremely reactionary portion of the Cuban community in the country.""

In fact, during the Republican primary in 2016, President Trump did very poorly among Cuban voters in Florida, as compared to other candidates. Hostility and economic attacks on Cuba do not serve his electoral interests, and affect Cubans severely. The U.S. President continues to be badly advised,"" the Cuban Foreign Minister argued on Twitter.

Despite the tightening of the blockade, Cuba will continue the natural, inevitable process of developing better relations with its citizens abroad and their descendants.

In context

-The ""Dialogue of '78"", promoted by the historical leader of the Cuban Revolution, Fidel Castro Ruz, represented the beginning of a continuous, irreversible process of rapprochement between Cuba and the Cuban community abroad.

-During his recent visit to Argentina, Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel officially announced plans to hold the Fourth Conference on Nation and Emigration, at a meeting with Cubans living there.

-Cuban diplomatic missions have identified the presence of Cuban communities in 124 countries.

-Approximately 1,485,618 native born Cubans residing abroad have been identified, not counting their descendants. Of these, 1,195,607 are registered with Cuban consulates.

497,1533545806,['Beth Harris'],Pioneering Soap Opera Creator Lee Phillip Bell Dead At 91,en,,,,Bell also hosted her own daytime talk show in Chicago for 33 years.,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — Lee Phillip Bell, who co-created “The Young and the Restless” and “The Bold and the Beautiful” and hosted her own daytime talk show in Chicago for 33 years, has died. She was 91.

Bell died Tuesday of natural causes at her home in Los Angeles, according to Eva Basler, a spokeswoman for the family and their company Bell-Phillip Television Productions.

“Our mother was a loving and supportive wife, mother and grandmother,” her family said in a statement. “Gracious and kind, she enriched the lives of all who knew her. We will miss her tremendously.”

Bell and her husband William J. Bell co-created two of daytime television’s most successful and enduring dramas. “Y&R” has been on the air since 1973, while “The Bold and the Beautiful” will mark its 33rd anniversary in March.

Born in Chicago on June 9, 1928, Bell began her career as a broadcast journalist in her hometown, where she hosted and produced her eponymous daytime talk show from 1953-1986 on WBBM-TV, the local CBS affiliate. She explored timely social issues and concerns, while also interviewing Presidents Gerald Ford and Ronald Reagan, Judy Garland, Clint Eastwood, Oprah Winfrey, Lucille Ball and the Beatles and Rolling Stones. She won 16 regional Emmy Awards for her show.

Bell also produced and narrated several award-winning specials and documentaries on such topics as foster children, rape and divorce.

Bell won a Daytime Emmy award for outstanding drama series for “Y&R” in 1975. She received a lifetime achievement award from the Daytime Emmys in 2007.

Her husband died in 2005. She is survived by her sons William and Bradley and daughter Lauralee Bell Martin, who appears on “Y&R.” William Bell is president and CEO of the family’s production company. Bradley is executive producer and head writer for “The Bold and the Beautiful.”

Her daughter-in-law, Colleen Bell, served as U.S. ambassador to Hungary during President Barack Obama’s administration and is executive director of the California Film Commission. Another daughter-in-law, Maria Arena Bell, is a former head writer on “Y&R.” Her other survivors are son-in-law Scott Martin and eight grandchildren.",https://www.huffpost.com/entry/lee-phillip-bell-soap-opera-dead_n_5e57fa48c5b60102210dc374,,,"['Barack Obama', 'Arts and Entertainment', 'We All Belong', 'Extremism', 'The State of Abortion', 'obituary', 'Social Justice', 'The Young and the Restless', 'Joe Biden', 'The Bold and the Beautiful', 'colleen bell', 'Congress', 'HuffPost Press Room', 'Coronavirus']"

Mthembu said Ramaphosa will now address the nation only on Monday “because we do not want to take short cuts”.

Said Mthembu: “It will not be helpful for the president to speak to the people of South Africa when the structure that advises him, which is the national command council, has not concluded its business and looked at all the issues that affect South Africans.

“Let us assume that the meeting concludes at midnight, then it will be unfair for the president to address people who are sleeping.”",https://web.archive.org/web/20200323170330id_/https://www.heraldlive.co.za/news/2020-03-22-covid-19-ramaphosa-cancels-planned-address-to-nation-tonight/,,,

Submariners likely unaware of coronavirus pandemic,en,,,,"Mariners aboard ballistic submarines are habitually spared bad news while underwater to avoid undermining their morale, say current and former officers who served aboard France's nuclear-armed subs.","The crews of nuclear-armed submarines may be among the last pockets of people anywhere who are still blissfully unaware of how the coronavirus pandemic is turning life upside down.

Of a world in coronavirus turmoil, they may know little or nothing. Submariners stealthily cruising the ocean deeps, purposefully shielded from worldly worries to encourage undivided focus on their top-secret missions of nuclear deterrence, may be among the last pockets of people anywhere who are still blissfully unaware of how the pandemic is turning life upside down.

Mariners aboard ballistic submarines are habitually spared bad news while underwater to avoid undermining their morale, say current and former officers who served aboard France's nuclear-armed subs.

So any crews that left port before the virus spread around the globe are likely being kept in the dark about the extent of the rapidly unfurling crisis by their commanders until their return, they say.

""They won't know,"" said retired Adm. Dominique Salles, who commanded the French ballistic submarine squadron from 2003-2006. ""The boys need to be completely available for their mission.""

Speaking exclusively to The Associated Press, Salles said he believes submariners will likely only be told of the pandemic as they head back to port, in the final two days of their mission.

""Those who are at sea don't need this information,"" said Salles, who also commanded the nuclear-armed French submarine ""L'Inflexible"".

""The commander, I think, is doubtless informed about what is happening. I don't think he'll have all the details,"" he said.

The French navy won't divulge what has or hasn't been said to submarine crews. Nor will it say whether any of the four French ballistic submarines, laden with 16 missiles that each can carry six nuclear warheads, left harbor before France instituted a nationwide lockdown on March 17.

""Because the deterrent is wrapped in a bubble of protection and confidentiality, it is impossible to know whether the crews are informed or not of this situation,"" French navy spokesman Lt Cmdr Olivier Ribard said.

French submarine missions last 60 to 70 days, with about 110 crew members aboard. So a crew that left at the end of February wouldn't be expected back before the end of April. In that case, they will return to a world changed by the pandemic. On March 1, France had just 130 confirmed COVID-19 cases and two deaths. In under a month, those numbers have surged past 2,600 dead and over 40,000 sickened.

For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. But for some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, and death.

For submariners, the return to land could be a shock.

""They won't have experienced the crisis as we did, with a bit of fear, the lockdown. So for them it will be quite a surprise. They will learn the history, but it will be a history that is related to them,"" said a serving officer who was the doctor on the ballistic submarine ""Le Triomphant"" for four years.

He spoke to the AP on condition that he be identified only by his first name and rank, in accordance with the rules of his branch of the French military.

""All events that could affect or change the morale of the crew members are kept from them,"" said the officer, Chief Doctor Gabriel.

""Since there is no internet, no radio and no television on board, the only news you get comes from messages received by the commander, and the commander filters the messages to not give all of the information to everyone.""

The doctor was underwater in 2012 when an Islamic extremist killed three French paratroopers and later killed a rabbi, his two young sons and grabbed an 8-year-old girl and shot her in the head.

Only later did the officer learn of the attacks, ""so when people talk to me about it, I find it impossible to imagine,"" he said.

""The only place where you are really cut off from all information is underwater, because even on a vessel in space there is still the radio, television, the internet,"" he said.

When bombings hit Madrid in 2004, Salles didn't inform submariners who were at sea for the ballistic flotilla that was then under his command.

Salles said the situation now will be toughest for any crews that leave harbour in the weeks ahead, because they'll know they are leaving loved ones in the midst of the pandemic and, possibly, still living in lockdown.

The French government has already extended its stay-home orders once, to April 15, and said it could do so again.

Salles said he believes those crews will get regular coronavirus updates, but won't be told of any family deaths until they are returning to the l'Ile Longue submarine base near Brest in Brittany.

Salles was at sea in a sub when his father died. The news was kept from him until he had finished his 60-day mission.

""No matter how serious an event is, there is nothing a submariner can do about it. And since he cannot do anything, better that he know nothing,"" Salles said. ""They know that they won't know and accept it. It's part of our deal.""",https://www.indiatoday.in/world/story/blissful-ignorance-submariners-likely-unaware-coronavirus-pandemic-1661410-2020-03-30?utm_source=rss,,,

An international non-governmental organisation, The Press Emblem Campaign, based in Geneva, Switzerland, said 55 journalists have died from the coronavirus disease in 23 countries across Africa, Europe, the Americas, Asia, and the Middle East.

This was contained in a report released by the organisation on Friday ahead of the World Press Freedom Day 2020 scheduled for Sunday, May 3.

According to the body, the countries with fatalities were Algeria, Austria, Bangladesh, Belgium, Brazil, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Egypt, France, Iran, Italy, Japan, Morocco, Mexico, Peru, Russia, Spain, Sweden, Togo, United Kingdom, United States, Venezuela, and Zimbabwe.

The NGO, which aim at “strengthening the legal protection and safety of journalists in zones of conflict and civil unrest or in dangerous missions”, also condemned the press freedom violations that have occurred in several countries since the start of the pandemic.

It noted that protective measures for the media have been insufficient since the outbreak became full-blown in March.

“Journalists are at great risk in this health crisis because they must continue to inform, by going to hospitals, interviewing doctors, nurses, political leaders, specialists, scientists, patients. In various countries, the indispensable protective measures (social distancing, wearing masks, hygiene measures, quarantine) have not been applied, especially at the beginning of the epidemic.

“The fight against the coronavirus is being used as a pretext by some governments to suppress freedoms of expression, assembly, and demonstration. We condemn these excessive and unjustified violations and call on all States to respect the right of citizens to information and their right to health,” said PEC Secretary-General, Blaise Lempen.

The SG stressed that governments must allow journalists to objectively report the pandemic without gagging their freedom of expression or controlling their reportage for political reasons.

According to authorities of the rainbow nation, the border wall is expected to keep undocumented migrants and individuals Infected with the Coronavirus from entering the country.

According to South African public works minister, Patricia de Lille, construction of the border wall is a part of the emergency procedures adopted by the Cyril Ramaphosa led government to tackle the Coronavirus epidemic currently spreading across South Africa.

South African President, Cyril Ramaphosa declared a state of emergency on Sunday due to the Coronavirus epidemic.

According to the public works Minister, Ramaphosa ordered that border crossings into south Africa be closed but the measure will not be effective if the fences on the border are not secure.

The ministers said further that;

“A 1.8m (5ft 11in) high fence, stretching for 20km (12.4 miles), would be built on either side of the Beitbridge border, the main crossing between the two nations.”

South Africa currently has 150 individuals Infected with the Coronavirus.

Thousand of Zimbabwean citizens currently live in South Africa, many of them fleeing hard economic conditions and political violence in their home country.

South Africa has tried to reduce migration from Zimbabwe and other parts of Africa in the past.

Zimbabwe has no case of the Coronavirus so far although President Mnangagwa has ordered all schools to be shut from Tuesday as a precautionary measure.

by the El Reportero‘s news services

With few revelers to play to at Plaza Garibaldi, Mexico City’s mariachi mecca, some 120 musicians traveled to a hospital in the south of the capital on Tuesday afternoon to serenade Covid-19 patients and the medical personnel treating them.

Wearing face masks (which trumpeters lowered temporarily in order to play their instruments) and maintaining a “healthy distance” from each other, the musicians assembled outside the National Institute of Respiratory Diseases, where they played a range of classic mariachi songs.

Their aim, said National Mariachi Association spokesman Julio César Barragán, was to lift the spirits of people suffering from Covid-19 or other respiratory diseases and to show their solidarity with them and the doctors and nurses treating them.

“The distancing protocols were followed by the mariachis,” he added.

The serenata coincided with World Health Day, a World Health Organization initiative whose main purpose this year is to celebrate the work of nurses and midwives and remind world leaders of the critical role they play in keeping the world healthy.

Singer Leo Dan did not die: I am alive and kicking

The quarantine of dozens of countries in the world that forced the isolation of millions of people, seems to have given more time to those users on social networks who are responsible for spreading false information to make the unwary fall, who they take for granted. everything you see on these digital platforms.

This Saturday morning, Argentine singer and songwriter Leopoldo Dante Tevez, better known as Leo Dan, became a trend on social networks after he claimed that the artist had died, apparently a product of the coronavirus.

His fans mourned the death of the artist and even expressed their condolences to the family; however, it was all a fake news that, the same singer Leo Dan had to come out to deny through a video he recorded from the balcony of his residence. (Reported by RCN Radio).

Spanish singer-songwriter Luis Eduardo Aute dies

The well-known Spanish singer-songwriter Luis Eduardo Aute died this Saturday in a Madrid hospital at the age of 76, according to sources in his family circle quoted by several media.

Considered one of the main references of the author’s song in Spain, Aute (Manila, Sept. 13, 1943) was retired from the stage since the summer of 2016, when he suffered a serious heart attack that kept him almost two months in a coma.

That year, the musician, visual artist, filmmaker and poet completed half a century of his career and was preparing to close the performances in the Fiestas Colombinas de Huelva.

To celebrate the 50th anniversary of his first studio recording, he organized the La Gira Luna tour, which began with a recital at the National Auditorium in Mexico and took him on a tour of Spain with 15 concerts, one of them on June 21 in Madrid as part of a solidarity initiative to help refugees.

On Aug. 8 of that year he suffered a heart attack and was in a coma for 48 days. He recovered slowly and in 2018 his colleagues gave him a tribute concert.

Some twenty artists, including Joaquin Sabina, Joan Manuel Serrat, the Cuban Silvio Rodriguez and Ana Belen, joined together on a historic night to send encouragement to the artist.

In May 2016 he even accompanied the Cuban troubadour in a multitudinous free performance in the Madrid neighbourhood of Vallecas, with the aim of collecting economic and material donations for those affected by the earthquake that had occurred a month earlier in Ecuador.

The 1970s and 1980s were the decades of greatest impact for this multifaceted creator, coinciding with the restoration of democracy in Spain and the rise of singer-songwriters.

GREEN Senior citizens now have another choice for care as they age following the opening of the Village of Saint Edward.

St. Edward offers independent living, assisted living and memory care units. There are 50 independent, 48 assisted living and 28 memory care units. So far, 14 residents have moved in, but many more are expected in early 2020.

Annette Walters, director of Marketing for the Village of Saint Edward, said almost half of the independent units have been reserved. She said it is a good start considering the facility opened at the end of October.

Construction was completed two months ahead of schedule and Walters said they are thankful for Alpha Construction, DeHoff Development and the city for being good partners.

Saint Edward just recently received its license from the state for assisted living and memory care so it could begin taking residents.

The facility offers plenty of common space areas for residents and their visitors. There are also several dining rooms, a pub, a library area, a fitness room, a beauty shop and a chapel where a service takes place three times per week.

Walters said all the dining services are like a restaurant and there is a daily chef special. Residents can also order items a la carte. The facility has a private dining room for families if they want to host a gathering.

Several different floor plans for each unit are available for residents including one and two-bedroom units. All independent rooms have a washer and dryer along with full kitchen appliances.

The memory care wing of the building has its own entrance for family members as Walters said family members are given key fobs so they can enter. The memory care wing also has its dining area including seating at a counter where residents can watch the food being prepared.

There is also a snoezelen room, which a sensory room where memory care residents can go to calm down.

Walters said St. Edward’s strives on helping residents if they need to transition from independent living to assisted living and they don’t have to leave the facility.

The entire facility offers several areas to sit outside and plenty of areas to walk.

“This is a beautiful piece of property,” Walters said. “You want to take advantage of that.”

Residents also take occasional trips including to Cleveland and Amish Country, just to name a few.

Saint Edward has hired 60 employees and once it is fully staffed that number will go to more than 100. Walters said St. Edward is sensitive to who they hire and wanted to hire staff who care.

She believes the fact the facility is faith-based and its quality staff makes it stand out from similar facilities in the area. Saint Edward is also a not-for-profit facility, so once someone’s finances run out, they can remain at the facility on Medicare.

In 2020, Saint Edward plans to volunteer and give back more in the community, Walters said. They are also looking for volunteers who may want to come in and spend time with residents.

“We have volunteers at all of our campuses,” Walters said.

Saint Edward also has a facility in Fairlawn and a facility in Wadsworth, which just opened in June. The Wadsworth facility is already 70 percent full and the Fairlawn location stays full, Walters said.

“We took on two big challenges in one year,” Walters said.",https://www.thesuburbanite.com/lifestyle/20200101/village-of-saint-edward-opens-in-green?rssfeed=true,,,

This February 22, there will be a march from Australia House in London to Parliament Square, the centre of British democracy. People will carry pictures of the Australian publisher and journalist Julian Assange who, on 24 February, faces a court that will decide whether or not he is to be extradited to the United States and a living death.

I know Australia House well. As an Australian myself, I used to go there in my early days in London to read the newspapers from home. Opened by King George V over a century ago, its vastness of marble and stone, chandeliers and solemn portraits, imported from Australia when Australian soldiers were dying in the slaughter of the First World War, have ensured its landmark as an imperial pile of monumental servility.

As one of the oldest “diplomatic missions” in the United Kingdom, this relic of empire provides a pleasurable sinecure for Antipodean politicians: a “mate” rewarded or a troublemaker exiled.

Known as High Commissioner, the equivalent of an ambassador, the current beneficiary is George Brandis, who as Attorney General tried to water down Australia’s Race Discrimination Act and approved raids on whistleblowers who had revealed the truth about Australia’s illegal spying on East Timor during negotiations for the carve-up of that impoverished country’s oil and gas.

This led to the prosecution of whistleblowers Bernard Collaery and “Witness K” on bogus charges. Like Julian Assange, they are to be silenced in a Kafkaesque trial and put away.

Australia House is the ideal starting point for Saturday’s march.

“I confess,” wrote Lord Curzon, Viceroy of India, in 1898, “that countries are pieces on a chessboard upon which is being played out a great game for the domination of the world.””

We Australians have been in the service of the Great Game for a very long time. Having devastated our Indigenous people in an invasion and a war of attrition that continues to this day, we have spilt blood for our imperial masters in China, Africa, Russia, the Middle East, Europe and Asia. No imperial adventure against those with whom we have no quarrel has escaped our dedication.

Deception has been a feature. When Prime Minister Robert Menzies sent Australian soldiers to Vietnam in the 1960s, he described them as a training team, requested by a beleaguered government in Saigon. It was a lie. A senior official of the Department of External Affairs wrote secretly that “although we have stressed the fact publicly that our assistance was given in response to an invitation by the government of South Vietnam”, the order came from Washington.”

Two versions. The lie for us, the truth for them. As many as four million people died in the Vietnam war.

When Indonesia invaded East Timor in 1975, the Australian Ambassador, Richard Woolcott, secretly urged the government in Canberra to “act in a way which would be designed to minimise the public impact in Australia and show private understanding to Indonesia.” In other words, to lie. He alluded to the beckoning spoils of oil and gas in the Timor Sea which, boasted Foreign Minister Gareth Evans, were worth “zillions”.

In the genocide that followed, at least 200,000 East Timorese died. Australia recognised, almost alone, the legitimacy of the occupation.

When Prime Minister John Howard sent Australian special forces to invade Iraq with America and Britain in 2003, he – like George W. Bush and Tony Blair – lied that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. More than a million people died in Iraq.

WikiLeaks was not the first to call out the pattern of criminal lying in democracies that remain every bit as rapacious as in Lord Curzon’s day. The achievement of the remarkable publishing organisation founded by Julian Assange has been to provide the proof.

WikiLeaks has informed us how illegal wars are fabricated, how governments are overthrown and violence is used in our name, how we are spied upon through our phones and screens. The true lies of presidents, ambassadors, political candidates, generals, proxies, political fraudsters have been exposed. One by one, these would-be emperors have realised they have no clothes.

It has been an unprecedented public service; above all, it is authentic journalism, whose value can be judged by the degree of apoplexy of the corrupt and their apologists.

For example, in 2016, WikiLeaks published the leaked emails of Hillary Clinton’s campaign manager John Podesta, which revealed a direct connection between Clinton, the foundation she shares with her husband and the funding of organised jihadism in the Middle East – terrorism.

One email disclosed that Islamic State (ISIS) was bankrolled by the governments of Saudi Arabia and Qatar, from which Clinton accepted huge “donations”. Moreover, as US Secretary of State, she approved the world’s biggest ever arms sale to her Saudi benefactors, worth more than $80 billion. Thanks to her, US arms sales to the world – for use in stricken countries like Yemen – doubled.

Revealed by WikiLeaks and published in The New York Times, the Podesta emails triggered a vituperative campaign against editor-in-chief Julian Assange which was bereft of evidence. He was said to be an “agent of Russia working to elect Trump”; the nonsensical Russiagate followed. That WikiLeaks had also published more than 800,000 frequently damning documents about the Russian government was ignored.

On an Australian Broadcasting Corporation programme, Four Corners, in 2017, Clinton was interviewed by Sarah Ferguson, who began: “No one could fail to be moved by the pain on your face at [the moment of Donald Trump’s inauguration] … Do you remember how visceral it was for you?”

Having established Clinton’s visceral suffering, the fawning Ferguson described “Russia’s role” and the “damage done personally to you” by Julian Assange.

Clinton replied, “He [Assange] is very clearly a tool of Russian intelligence. And he has done their bidding.”

Ferguson said to Clinton, “Lots of people, including in Australia, think that Assange is a martyr of free speech and freedom of information. How would you describe him?”

Again, Clinton was allowed to defame Assange – a “nihilist” in the service of “dictators” – while Ferguson assured her interviewee she was “the icon of your generation.”

There was no mention of a leaked document, revealed by WikiLeaks, called Libya Tick Tock, prepared for Hillary Clinton, which described her as the central figure driving the destruction of the Libyan state in 2011. This resulted in 40,000 deaths, the arrival of ISIS in North Africa and the European refugee and migrant crisis.

For me, this episode of Clinton’s interview – and there are many others – vividly illustrates the division between false and true journalism. On 24 February, when Julian Assange steps into Woolwich Crown Court, true journalism will be the only crime on trial.

I am sometimes asked why I have championed Assange. For one thing, I like and I admire him. He is a friend with astonishing courage; and he has a finely honed, wicked sense of humour. He is the diametric opposite of the character invented then assassinated by his enemies.

As a reporter in places of upheaval all over the world, I have learned to compare the evidence I have witnessed with the words and actions of those with power. In this way, it is possible to get a sense of how our world is controlled and divided and manipulated, how language and debate are distorted to produce the propaganda of false consciousness.

When we speak about dictatorships, we call this brainwashing: the conquest of minds. It is a truth we rarely apply to our own societies, regardless of the trail of blood that leads back to us and which never dries.

WikiLeaks has exposed this. That is why Assange is in a maximum security prison in London facing concocted political charges in America, and why he has shamed so many of those paid to keep the record straight. Watch these journalists now look for cover as it dawns on them that the American fascists who have come for Assange may come for them, not least those on The Guardian who collaborated with WikiLeaks and won prizes and secured lucrative book and Hollywood deals based on his work, before turning on him.

In 2011, David Leigh, The Guardian’s “investigations editor”, told journalism students at City University in London that Assange was “quite deranged.” When a puzzled student asked why, Leigh replied, “Because he doesn’t understand the parameters of conventional journalism.”

But it’s precisely because he did understand that the “parameters” of the media often shielded vested and political interests and had nothing to do with transparency that the idea of WikiLeaks was so appealing to many people, especially the young, rightly cynical about the so-called “mainstream.”

Leigh mocked the very idea that, once extradited, Assange would end up “wearing an orange jumpsuit.” These were things, he said, “that he and his lawyer are saying in order to feed his paranoia.”

The current US charges against Assange centre on the Afghan Logs and Iraq Logs, which the Guardian published and Leigh worked on, and on the Collateral Murder video showing an American helicopter crew gunning down civilians and celebrating the crime. For this journalism, Assange faces 17 charges of “espionage” which carry prison sentences totaling 175 years.

Whether or not his prison uniform will be an “orange jumpsuit,” US court files seen by Assange’s lawyers reveal that, once extradited, Assange will be subject to Special Administrative Measures, known as SAMS.

A 2017 report by Yale University Law School and the Center for Constitutional Rights described SAMS as “the darkest corner of the US federal prison system” combining “the brutality and isolation of maximum security units with additional restrictions that deny individuals almost any connection to the human world … The net effect is to shield this form of torture from any real public scrutiny.”

That Assange has been right all along, and getting him to Sweden was a fraud to cover an American plan to “render” him, is finally becoming clear to many who swallowed the incessant scuttlebutt of character assassination.

“I speak fluent Swedish and was able to read all the original documents,” Nils Melzer, the United Nations Rapporteur on Torture, said recently. “I could hardly believe my eyes. According to the testimony of the woman in question, a rape had never taken place at all. And not only that: the woman’s testimony was later changed by the Stockholm Police without her involvement in order to somehow make it sound like a possible rape. I have all the documents in my possession, the emails, the text messages.”

Keir Starmer is currently running for election as leader of the Labour Party in Britain. Between 2008 and 2013, he was Director of Public Prosecutions and responsible for the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). According to Freedom of Information searches by the Italian journalist Stefania Maurizi, Sweden tried to drop the Assange case in 2011, but a CPS official in London told the Swedish prosecutor not to treat it as “just another extradition”.

In 2012, she received an email from the CPS: “Don’t you dare get cold feet!!!”

Other CPS emails were either deleted or redacted. Why? Keir Starmer needs to say why.

At the forefront of Saturday’s march will be John Shipton, Julian’s father, whose indefatigable support for his son is the antithesis of the collusion and cruelty of the governments of Australia, our homeland.

The roll call of shame begins with Julia Gillard, the Australian Labor prime minister who, in 2010, wanted to criminalise WikiLeaks, arrest Assange and cancel his passport – until the Australian Federal Police pointed out that no law allowed this and that Assange had committed no crime.

While falsely claiming to give him consular assistance in London, it was the Gillard government’s shocking abandonment of its citizen that led to Ecuador granting political asylum to Assange in its London embassy.

In a subsequent speech before the US Congress, Gillard, a favourite of the US embassy in Canberra, broke records for sycophancy (according to the website Honest History) as she declared, over and again, the fidelity of America’s “mates Down Under.”

Today, while Assange waits in his cell, Gillard travels the world, promoting herself as a feminist concerned about “human rights,” often in tandem with that other right-on feminist, Hillary Clinton.

The truth is that Australia could have rescued Julian Assange and can still rescue him.

In 2010, I arranged to meet a prominent Liberal (Conservative) Member of Parliament, Malcolm Turnbull. As a young barrister in the 1980s, Turnbull had successfully fought the British Government’s attempts to prevent the publication of the book, Spycatcher, whose author Peter Wright, a spy, had exposed Britain’s “deep state”.

We talked about his famous victory for free speech and publishing and I described the miscarriage of justice awaiting Assange – the fraud of his arrest in Sweden and its connection with an American indictment that tore up the US Constitution and the rule of international law.

Turnbull appeared to show genuine interest and an aide took extensive notes. I asked him to deliver a letter to the Australian government from Gareth Peirce, the renowned British human rights lawyer who represents Assange.

In the letter, Peirce wrote, “Given the extent of the public discussion, frequently on the basis of entirely false assumptions… it is very hard to attempt to preserve for [Julian Assange] any presumption of innocence. Mr. Assange has now hanging over him not one but two Damocles swords, of potential extradition to two different jurisdictions in turn for two different alleged crimes, neither of which are crimes in his own country, and that his personal safety has become at risk in circumstances that are highly politically charged.”

Turnbull promised to deliver the letter, follow it through and let me know. I subsequently wrote to him several times, waited and heard nothing.

In 2018, John Shipton wrote a deeply moving letter to the then prime minister of Australia asking him to exercise the diplomatic power at his government’s disposal and bring Julian home. He wrote that he feared that if Julian was not rescued, there would be a tragedy and his son would die in prison. He received no reply. The prime minister was Malcolm Turnbull.

Last year, when the current prime minister, Scott Morrison, a former public relations man, was asked about Assange, he replied in his customary way, “He should face the music!”

When Saturday’s march reaches the Houses of Parliament, said to be “the Mother of Parliaments,” Morrison and Gillard and Turnbull and all those who have betrayed Julian Assange should be called out; history and decency will not forget them or those who remain silent now.

And if there is any sense of justice left in the land of Magna Carta, the travesty that is the case against this heroic Australian must be thrown out. Or beware, all of us.

Since the age of 10 Sam Willis knew he wanted to be a paramedic but he never imagined he would become a successful lecturer, author, editor teaching paramedicine in two countries. The English born and raised senior lecturer has now been in Port Macquarie over a year and said he loves what he does. ""When I was about 10 I witnessed a car crash and watching the paramedics work I knew that was what I wanted to do when I grew up,"" Sam said. ""The paramedics I saw that day instinctively knew what to do and I thought they had all the answers to help the people who were hurt and I knew then I wanted to do the same thing when I got older. ""It hasn't always been an easy path to get where I wanted to go but I believe with passion and determination then you can get there. ""When I started as a paramedic in England I never thought I would go on to teach at universities in two countries or be an author but that is my life."" Mr Willis is a senior lecturer in paramedicine at Charles Sturt University based in Port macquarie, Mr Willis has a masters degree and is currently working towards a PhD in paramedicine, and said growing up his life wasn't easy but with a goal of where he wanted to end up his passion and drive got him there. ""I didn't get the marks at school to go and study what I wanted to right away so I had to go to college before going to university,"" he said. ""It wasn't easy and I had to make a lot of sacrifices but knowing what I wanted made it worth it. In the beginning I worked as an ambulance dispatcher and i didn't get into paramedicine the first time so it was challenging. ""I did question what I wanted and if it really was what I wanted but deep down I knew it was."" As a lecturer Mr Willis said he does sympathise with students who are struggling and prides himself on trying to help them. ""When I was studying the course was challenging which did make it hard at times but I am a big believer in even if something is hard you should go for it."" Mr Willis is the co-author and a contributor to a second edition of Fundamentals of Paramedic Practice, an accessible and comprehensive introduction to paramedic science and pre-hospital care, providing expert and up-to-date guidance on the essential theories and real-world practice of this dynamic area of emergency medicine.

The meeting was a follow-up to the OSCE Decision on the Update of the OSCE Principles Governing Non-proliferation, which designates the FSC as a forum for discussions on issues relating to the effective security of all nuclear materials and nuclear facilities in the OSCE area.

Ambassador Andrej Benedejčič, Chairperson of the Forum and Permanent Representative of Slovenia to the OSCE, opened the discussion by noting that two-thirds of all nuclear power plants in the world are located in the OSCE participating States. He added that OSCE participating States also account for 20 out of 30 countries with fully-fledged civilian nuclear programmes.

Ambassador Benedejčič emphasized the importance of managing radioactive sources, which must not fall into the wrong hands. ""Many terrorist organizations pose a potential threat to civilian nuclear facilities and subsequently to the peaceful use of nuclear technology and its applications,"" he said.

Andrej Stritar, Director of the Slovenian Nuclear Administration, noted the importance of co-operation between power plant operators, the police and the military. He highlighted the lessons learned from a recent unannounced force-on-force exercise on the premises of the Krško nuclear power plant, and described the arrangements the country currently has in place for the event of an airplane crash or a cyber security attack. ""Strengthening co-operation between civil and military authorities represents the main challenge,"" he said.

Juan Carlos Lentijo, Deputy Director General and Head of the Department of Nuclear Safety and Security of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) highlighted some of the Agency’s activities in this field. He discussed the IAEA's central role in strengthening the nuclear security framework, including the assistance it provides in work related to the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material and its Amendment and UN Security Council Resolution 1540. ""Like the OSCE, we promote international co-operation, which we see as an effective way to bolster nuclear security globally,"" he said.

Elena K. Sokova, Deputy Director of the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey, said: ""The OSCE participating States own and host the lion's share of global nuclear facilities, materials and radioactive sources. Despite significant progress in strengthening nuclear security over the past 20 years, many challenges and vulnerabilities remain."" She added that the OSCE participating States are at the forefront of emerging technologies that could have both negative and positive impacts on nuclear security and countering terrorism.

""The OSCE’s ongoing work to counter terrorism, secure borders, combat trafficking in arms and human beings, and protect against cybercrime are integral elements in addressing nuclear security challenges,"" she said. ""Both the individual participating States and the Organization itself are well positioned to contribute to policy changes and work with various branches of government, industry and the professional community to enhance nuclear security.""

Roger Howsley, Executive Director of the World Institute for Nuclear Security (WINS), spoke of the need for personnel with responsibilities for nuclear security to be demonstrably competent. He called on OSCE participating States to support the development of comparable, certified professional training courses for nuclear security as already exist for aviation security, and to encourage the IAEA to take a lead role.

He also said that WINS has become a member of the International Gender Champions Initiative and intends to identify and overcome the barriers to women's greater participation in nuclear security.

863,1484117411,,Thor Just Became The Most Powerful [SPOILER] in History,en,,,,Marvel is relaunching Thor as the most powerful superhero in their entire pantheon - and giving him an incredible power-up that he's never had before!,"This article contains spoilers for Thor #1!

Thor has just become more powerful than ever before. Jason Aaron's years-long Thor run has come to a dramatic close, and it's time for a fresh beginning for the God of Thunder. Aaron ended with Thor regaining his enchanted hammer, Mjolnir, and taking the throne of the All-Father of Asgard.

Step forward Donny Cates, who's becoming one of Marvel's most prolific writers and the architect of all their cosmic plots. The first issue of Cates' Thor relaunch sees the God of Thunder prepare to give a speech to his people, one that's interrupted by the untimely arrival of Galactus, dying after exposure to a cosmic force known as the Great Black Winter.

According to Galactus, the Great Black Winter has revealed that Thor is destined to be his death. As a result, operating under the principle of ""keep your friends close, and your enemies closer,"" Galactus appoints Thor Odinson as his new Herald, transforming him with the Power Cosmic. In the Directors' Cut, Cates describes the transformation like this:

Thor rises, and he has been remade. His arm is back, as is his eye, and his hair is now LONG. Like down to his butt long. Like the nineties Thor that I love. He's also wearing a slick new costume, very sci-fi and slick. Mostly black and bright white. The white on his costume should be glowing like lightning. And the black should be made of a star field. His eyes glow as well. Crackling with energy. His hammer, a solid Mjolnir-shaped bolt of lightning. He has become cosmic-Zeus! His run sigil emblazoned on his chest. Smoke pouring off him.

This is easily the most phenomenal power-up Thor has ever received. He's never exactly been a weakling, but now he possesses all the power of the God of Thunder; wields an enchanted hammer containing a God Tempest that can destroy entire star systems; has been granted the power of the All-Father himself; and also wields the Power Cosmic, meaning he should have all the powers of any other Herald of Galactus. He's officially the strongest Avenger, the mightiest god in any of Marvel's Pantheons, and the greatest Herald ever to serve Galactus.

Donny Cates is a smart writer. That means he wouldn't have given Thor this level of power if he didn't have a story in mind that would demand it. What's more, in interviews Cates has insisted he still sees Thor as a young god, a flawed man given to fits of temper and in danger of being overcome by his own ego and pride. Galactus' prophecy - foretelling that the God of Thunder will, in fact, be the one responsible for his own destruction - suggests that Thor Odinson may well not be able to handle the vast, unfathomable powers that are now at his disposal. Will absolute power corrupt absolutely?

We started to see more of this with Sandi and Noel but almost never with Mel and Sue because one of them would start cursing to the camera while the other talked the contestant off a cliff (the BBC couldn't air any of this footage because of the cursing).

Move will bring in better financial discipline among entities, according to Finance Minister

In a major announcement during her Budget 2020 speech, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharamam said State-owned Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) was set to go public. Ms. Sitharaman on Saturday said the Narendra Modi government plans to sell a part of its stake in the entity through an initial public offering (IPO) and raise funds.

Sitharaman, however, did not give details such as what percentage of holding would be sold or when it would take place. Listing of companies on stock exchanges “discipline a company and provides access to financial markets and unlocks its value. It also gives (an) opportunity for retail investors to participate in the wealth so created,” she said.

The government owns 100% stake in LIC, which was set up in 1956 and remains the country’s largest state-run insurer. LIC increased its share of the first-year premium income in the first nine months of this fiscal, rising to 70.52% from 66.24% recorded in 2018-19. According to Bloomberg estimates, its assets roughly equal $433 billion (over ₹30 lakh crore).

By the Solstice bonfire

I pulled him aside and told him about the colors

The colors of spontaneous remission

He the adjuster of bones listened



While the fire fed on the darkness

Of our annual lost-and-foundness

Our circle much enlarged

All of us were there for one thing



And one thing only

Gazing into the fire

So long as I am you are we

Are just like children here



I'll tell you how it all got started

(Have you noticed how that old tree

Poised in the fire-glow seems to want

To be photographed and shared)



The reach of the fire is astounding

The flames come apart

Like a wing separating from the body of a bird

As if flight were more important than life



And as I told you my story

Our faces were refreshed by the fire

You, joint-healer, bone-mender, husband and father

Me the old poet dream-worker, husband, father, son of my father



Me out of work can you believe it But no matter

We both know something that the other craved

For surely just as the fire reaches up

A vortex spirals down



And out of this elision of realities comes remission

The story starts when the old raven came to me

When I was still partly raven myself

Just when I was about to climb down into the human world



It was then he fixed his gaze upon me

And then I got sick and forgot what he told me

And later there were the colors and I found myself

Holding a baby and weeping and I was well



And I was human as ravens do not weep

And my bones were no longer hollow

And such a wonder has never happened since

But here we are and this too may never repeat",https://www.opednews.com/articles/Ravens-do-not-weep-by-Gary-Lindorff-Poem_Poetry-191227-921.html,,,"['Poem', 'Poetry']"

They were then asked to sign a form.ICE has declined to release the form.Gee wrote that she didn't find that ICE officially sought to get those formal waivers, but that officers' conversations with detained parents ""caused confusion and unnecessary emotional upheaval and did not appear to serve the agency's legitimate purpose of making continuous individualized inquiries regarding efforts to release minors.""While some parents reported slightly different details, the lawyers said they broadly believed they were being asked to choose between staying in custody with their children or letting their children leave.""They were asking mothers to separate from their 1-year-old infants to go to a sponsor that perhaps had never even met or known the child,"" said Bridget Cambria, executive director of the group ALDEA, which represents families at the ICE detention center in Leesport, Pennsylvania.The Trump administration again faced allegations that it is trying to separate immigrant families as part of an overall border crackdown. The separation of immigrant families drew bipartisan condemnation in 2018 when the Trump administration implemented a ""zero tolerance"" policy on southern border crossings.U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement accused advocates of making ""misrepresentations"" and says it remains in compliance with President Donald Trump's June 2018 executive order intended to stop family separation. In a statement Thursday, the agency said the form was used as part of a ""routine parole review consistent with the law"" and Gee's previous orders.""The court recognized that parents, not the government, should decide whether the juvenile should be released to a sponsor,"" the agency said. ""To comply with this order, ICE was required to check with each of the juveniles - and their parents - in custody ... to make individual parole determinations with respect to those juveniles.""In court papers filed May 15, the government noted more than 170 times that it had refused to release children currently in detention because the ""parent does not wish to separate.""

It has expelled hundreds of children within a few days of their crossing the border with Mexico instead of turning them over to government facilities designed to care for them, as normally required by federal law.The agency says it releases most families from its detention centers within 20 days, the general limit under the Flores settlement for holding children in a secure facility.But many families currently in custody have been detained for months, some since last year.Advocates contend that ICE should release all families from detention especially as the coronavirus has spread rapidly through immigration detention, with more than 1,100 people contracting COVID-19 and a positive test rate of about 50%. At ICE's largest family detention center in Dilley, Texas, the detainees include a child with epilepsy, a 1-year-old with breathing problems, and several children with heart murmurs, according to Shalyn Fluharty, director of the legal group Proyecto Dilley.ICE says it has released hundreds of people deemed to have heightened exposure to the virus, though it has contested lawsuits across the country demanding the releases of others.The Trump administration is also currently appealing Gee's order last year stopping it from terminating the Flores agreement.",https://web.archive.org/web/20200616050803id_/https://6abc.com/politics/judge-demands-ice-better-explain-why-it-wont-release-kids/6206516/,,,"['ICE', 'politics', 'u.s. & world', 'coronavirus', 'ice', 'Art of Aging']"

RICHMOND, Va. — When Gov. Ralph Northam declared a state of emergency over the coronavirus pandemic Thursday, a state law against price gouging kicked into effect.

The law, enacted in 2004, stops business from charging ""unconscionable prices"" for things like water, ice, food, cleaning products, hand sanitizers and medicines for the 30-day period following the state of emergency.

State Attorney General Mark Herring said this law protects Virginians against scammers when they are most vulnerable.

""I would encourage all Virginians to pay attention to any prices that seem too high, and contact my office as soon as possible if you think someone may be illegally overcharging for necessary goods or running a scam,"" Herring said.

The CDC recommends washing your hands, using hand sanitizer and disinfecting areas you touch often in your home and office as ways to slow the spread of coronavirus.

Two rockets hit the Green Zone in Iraq's capital of Baghdad, a day after Iran launched missile attacks on U.S. and other coalition targets at bases in Iraq, according to a report Wednesday.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average pared gains on the heels of the reports of an explosion in Baghdad. The Dow Jones closed 161 points higher, but about 80 points lower than it had been just before the news.

Iraq's military said that two Katyusha rockets fell inside the Green Zone, the section that contains the U.S. Embassy, other embassies of western nations and foreign businesses, according to Reuters.

There were no casualities, according to the statement from Iraq's military.

The White House and Pentagon had no immediate comment.

The rockets were fired several hours after President Donald Trump declared that Iran appeared to be standing down from the U.S. — remarks that sent stock indices surging higher.

On Tuesday night eastern time, Iran fired missile attacks against two Iraqi bases that house U.S. military and coalition forces.

The barrage was retaliation for the killing a week earlier of Iran's top military leader, Gen. Qasem Soleimani, in an U.S. airstrike in Baghdad.

Yes, Hilton has been laughing all the way to the fucking bank because her character on The Simple Life, and just her general persona has all been an act.

I. AM. SCREAMING.

Just days after we all collectively lost our minds over her Cooking With Paris video, the entrepreneur and socialite has revealed that her upcoming YouTube documentary This Is Paris will be the first time we get to see the real deal.

During an interview at the Television Critics Association press tour, Paris revealed that her upcoming YouTube documentary is “completely different than anything [she’s] ever done before.”

“Everything I’ve ever done before was more me playing that character again,” The Simple Life star said. “But with this, I really just wanted to pull the curtain back and show my real life — talk about things that are very hard to talk about and things that I’ve experienced in life but never discussed before.”

So she’s pretty much saying that The World According To Paris and The Simple Life was acting. Give this woman a fucking Golden Globe.

“I was having fun with it. I think, you know. I was in on the joke,” Paris said of the 2003 hit show The Simple Life, which she was pitched as “Green Acres meets Clueless.”

But the 38-year-old heiress is finally reading to show us the real Paris Hilton is her new YouTube documentary.

“In this film I discuss things I’ve never discussed before. I hope that people are going to see who I truly am,” she said.

“It follows me in my real life, everything I’ve done before was me playing a character. I was talking about things that are very hard to talk about. It was an amazing experience but it was very scary. I was freaking out.”

We really shouldn’t be surprised. She comes from a long list of uber-rich billionaire businessmen. The woman has simply mastered the art of branding.

“At the same time, I built a huge brand off doing it,” she told PEOPLE at the event. “So, I don’t really regret it and I’m happy that people are going to finally see this film.”

The mother of a British teenager found guilty of lying about being gang-raped in Cyprus has backed calls for a tourism boycott of the country.

The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that she supported the campaign and that she believed the resort town of Ayia Napa was unsafe.

“The place isn’t safe – it is absolutely not safe. And if you go and report something that’s happened to you, you’re either laughed at, as far as I can tell, or, in the worst case, something like what’s happened to my daughter may happen,” she said.

The teenager said she was raped by up to 12 Israeli tourists in a hotel room in Ayia Napa on 17 July.

But she was charged and the dozen young men, aged between 15 and 20, who were arrested over the incident, were freed after she signed a retraction statement 10 days later.

The woman said her daughter was experiencing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), hallucinations, and sleeping for up to 20 hours a day because of a condition called hypersomnia.

“She needs to get back to the UK to get that treated – that’s my absolute primary focus. She can’t be treated here because hearing foreign men speaking loudly will trigger an episode …

“It needs resolving otherwise she’s going to carry on having this for the rest of her life,” the woman said.

She said her daughter had planned to go to university this year after being accepted for the courses she applied for and being offered a bursary at one institute.

“So, no question, she would have gone to university, but it was in a career that she wouldn’t be able to do with this ‘public mischief’ verdict, so – again, life-changing for her – she needs to totally rethink her options.”

A crowdfunding appeal to raise money for legal support for her daughter has passed £80,000.

The “help teen victim get justice in Cyprus” GoFundMe page was set up in August by the British lawyer John Hobbs to raise cash for the 19-year-old’s legal representation.

The teenager claimed in court she was raped but forced to change her account under pressure from Cypriot police.

The Foreign Office said the UK was “seriously concerned” about the fairness of the woman’s trial and it is understood officials have raised the “deeply distressing case” with the Cypriot authorities.

Lawyers and campaigners criticised the justice system after the woman was convicted of public mischief at Famagusta district court, in Paralimni, on Monday.

The psychologist who assessed the woman as part of her defence case, Dr Christine Tizzard, said she was concerned the trial had not fully considered that she had been diagnosed with PTSD.

She told the Guardian: “The salient point is that she was diagnosed with PTSD. That’s a standalone diagnosis. It’s a valid diagnosis and it hasn’t really been fully represented.

“Aside the fact it hasn’t been fully represented, it means she’s been unable to get the treatment she so sorely needs and every day she’s not having treatment the worse it gets.”

The government of Cyprus has said it has “full confidence in the justice system and the courts”.

Cyprus’s attorney general said on Tuesday he could not suspend the trial because the woman had levelled “grave accusations” against police investigators that had to be adjudicated in court.

He said her allegation that police coerced her into retracting her rape claim “could not have been left to linger” so he could not move to suspend the trial.

In a statement, Costas Clerides added: “Any intervention on the part of the attorney general, either for reasons of public interest or any other reasons, would have constituted nothing more than an obstacle to ascertaining the true facts of the case, as well as interference in the judiciary’s work.”

Judge Michalis Papathanasiou said he believed the woman had made false allegations because she felt “embarrassed” after realising she had been filmed having sex in a video found on some of the Israelis’ mobile phones.

The woman has been on bail since the end of August, after spending a month in prison, and could face up to a year in jail and a €1,700 (£1,500) fine when she is sentenced on 7 January.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/01/british-teenagers-mother-calls-for-tourism-boycott-of-cyprus,,,

L'azienda sanitaria ddel Trenrino ha affrontato i principali argomenti con i medici di medicina generale, di continuità assistenziale e i pediatri di libera scelta

Come si comporta il coronavirus, come approcciare gli eventuali casi sospetti, probabili o confermati e quali le misure da adottare per proteggere la popolazione e i professionisti dal nuovo Coronavirus.

Questi i principali argomenti affrontati nel corso dell’incontro che si è tenuto oggi al Centro per i servizi sanitari di Trento con i referenti della task force coronavirus dell’Apss e i medici di medicina generale, di continuità assistenziale e i pediatri di libera scelta.



Quello di oggi è stato uno degli incontri organizzati sul territorio dopo che, venerdì 31 gennaio, sono state capillarmente fornite a tutti medici convenzionati con il servizio sanitario provinciale le indicazioni sulle procedure volte a garantire ai professionisti un’adeguata conoscenza dello schema organizzativo e dei percorsi operativi per fronteggiare questa prima fase dell’emergenza.



Ad introdurre la giornata è stato il direttore sanitario di Apss Pier Paolo Benetollo che ha ringraziato tutti i medici di medicina generale, i pediatri di libera scelta e i medici di continuità assistenziale per l’impegno, in stretta collaborazione con i servizi di Apss, ad affrontare nel modo migliore possibile l'emergenza coronavirus.

Benetollo ha inoltre ricordato la preziosa e costante collaborazione con la comunità cinese del Trentino alla quale ha rivolto un particolare ringraziamento.



«Una mattinata importante – ha detto Benetollo – per mantenere il massimo di unità fra tutti i sanitari, anche sul piano comunicativo, per cercare di arginare l'effetto confusivo che, sulla popolazione ma anche sui professionisti, rischia di essere indotto dal frenetico succedersi di informazioni, non sempre del tutto esatte e a volte addirittura vere e proprie fake news».

La parola è poi passata a Lucia Collini biologa dell’Unità operativa di microbiologia e virologia dell’ospedale Santa Chiara che è intervenuta sulle caratteristiche del virus e sulle complesse tecniche di laboratorio disponibili per individuarlo, a Luca Fabbri coordinatore del Comitato per la sorveglianza e il controllo delle Infezioni correlate ai processi assistenziali (Cipass) dell’Apss per la parte sui dispositivi di protezione individuale (DPI) e ad Arrigo Andrenacci direttore del Servizio territoriale, che ha illustrato l’organizzazione e le azioni a supporto dei medici di famiglia.

A chiudere la mattinata in rappresentanza del Dipartimento di prevenzione è intervenuta Mariagrazia Zuccali medico di igiene che ha illustrato le modalità di presa in carico e monitoraggio delle persone in isolamento volontario nella struttura di Sardagna.



Nel corso dell’incontro i medici sono stati informati che Apss è riuscita ad acquisire gli unici kit diagnostici attualmente disponibili sul mercato, che possono fornire una risposta sulla presenza del virus nel giro di poche ore.

Si tratta di strumenti diagnostici molto sofisticati che, naturalmente, possono essere utilizzati solo in laboratori altamente specializzati, quali il Laboratorio di microbiologia e virologia del Santa Chiara che in questa fase è allertato 24 ore su 24, 7 giorni su 7.

Sono state ribadite le raccomandazioni già divulgate nei giorni scorsi a cominciare dal fatto che le misure precauzionali per evitare il diffondersi del Coronavirus, sono le stesse di una serie di altre malattie respiratorie: l'igiene delle mani lavandole spesso con acqua e sapone o con soluzioni idroalcoliche, l’uso di fazzoletti di carta che devono essere buttati dopo l’utilizzo, lo starnutire o tossire in un fazzoletto o nel gomito flesso.



Nel caso di persone che rientrano dalla Cina, studenti compresi, è stato confermato l’invito a osservare un periodo di isolamento fiduciario per due settimane da effettuare a domicilio o in un centro di accoglienza.

Durante il periodo di isolamento domiciliare fiduciario le persone vengono contattate telefonicamente due volte al giorno dal personale sanitario dell’Apss, per verificare l’eventuale insorgenza di sintomi quali febbre, tosse, mal di gola.

Al termine del periodo di isolamento, Apss rilascia a ciascuna persona un’attestazione che certifica l’avvenuto isolamento domiciliare fiduciario senza manifestazione di sintomi della malattia, e quindi la piena sicurezza del rientro in comunità.



Tra le indicazioni date ai medici nel caso in cui vengano a conoscenza di un «caso sospetto» l’invito è di contattare il medico referente del proprio ambito territoriale, reperibile ventiquattro ore su ventiquattro, sette giorni su sette, che organizzerà la visita a domicilio insieme al medico di famiglia, fornendo al professionista sia i kit dei dispositivi di protezione individuale sia il materiale per eseguire, secondo i protocolli previsti, i tamponi nasofaringei da inviare al laboratorio Apss e all’ospedale Spallanzani di Roma per gli esami necessari.

Fatto questo, nel giro di poche ore, si potrà avere l’esito.

Arguing that a very small number of online ads - three-tenths of a percentage point of all on the web - disproportionately account for major portions of total network and CPU consumption, Google plans to scrub sites of such ads starting with a Stable build of Chrome near the end of August.

Chrome 85 is scheduled to release on Aug. 25, and would be the most likely version to debut the feature.

""These ads (such as those that mine cryptocurrency, are poorly programmed, or are unoptimized for network usage) can drain battery life, saturate already strained networks, and cost money,"" Marshall Vale, a Chrome product manager, wrote in a May 14 post to the Chromium blog.

When Chrome detects one of the über-aggressive ads, the browser will unload the content from the ad's frame - the portion of the page in which it's displayed - and refill the space with an error message stating ""Ad removed,"" along with a link to more information.

After copious measurements, Google decided to strip out any ad that consumed 4MB of network data, used the CPU during half of any 30-second span or tallied a total of 60 seconds of CPU usage. Those bars were so high that they affected only 0.3% of all ads, but, Google contended, such ads accounted for 27% of all ad-generated network traffic and 28% of all ad-related CPU usage.

Other browsers have addressed bad actors, including crypto-miners, using different approaches. Mozilla's Firefox, for example, blocks crypto-miners by targeting domains known to harbor such scripts. (Mozilla relies on domain lists produced by Disconnect.) It's not surprising that Google took a metrics-based route here; it typically bases decisions, or says it does, on data collected by Chrome and/or its search engine.

Chrome users can try out this ""Heavy Ad"" detection and removal prior to version 85 via the chrome://flags option page. Set the Heavy Ad Intervention flag (which also goes by #enable-heavy-ad-intervention) to Enabled and relaunch the browser.

Site developers and ad content creators should use the time between now and late August to test and, if necessary, alter first-party advertisements, Google said. ""Our intent with this extended rollout is to give appropriate time for ad creators and tool providers to prepare and incorporate these thresholds into their workflows,"" said Vale.

Detailed instructions on how to track removed ads using an API as well as how to test the resource usage of ad content were provided in this support document.",https://www.computerworld.com/article/3543814/chrome-85-to-erase-ads-that-hog-network-cpu-resources.html,,,

CLARK COUNTY, Ohio -- Health officials have identified 20 cases of COVID-19 linked to a Dole Fresh Vegetables packing plant in Clark County, Ohio.



Of the 20 cases, 12 are Dole employees (10 confirmed and two probable); eight are contacts of employees (five confirmed and three probable); and three cases involve people who do not live in Clark County, according to a statement released by the Clark County Combined Health District Tuesday, May 19.







The health district on Monday announced it was monitoring the first workplace outbreak in Clark County, and Tuesday, officials identified Dole as the company, according to the Springfield News-Sun.



In a statement to local news station WDTN, Dole maintained that the company has been in constant contact with the packing location since the potential outbreak was initially reported back in April:



“In addition to implementing all public health recommended precautions—social distancing, extensive hand washing, wearing of face masks at all times in our facilities, mandated self-quarantining of employees and contractors exposed to COVID-positive individuals, and increased frequency of deep cleaning and sanitation at the facility, especially in high touch areas—Dole has additionally welcomed CCCHD to come into and inspect the Springfield Salad Facility. Following the inspection, during which CCCHD noted the many protective procedures implemented by Dole, the facility implemented additional protocols based on their suggestions to further increase the safety of our employees and contractors. These include greater distancing and separation of workers in our facility, table dividers installed in our cafeteria and similar dividers in our packing room for added protection.""



Despite implementing additional safety measures, 10 Dole salad plant employees and contractors at the Ohio packing plant tested positive for COVID-19, according to the statement.



“We cannot state with certainty how the transmission occurred, but these results lead us to believe that the plant is not the source of transmission. No matter how the transmission occurred, however, Dole will continue to place employee health and well-being above all else in our efforts to keep fresh salads on shelves across the nation,“ the statement concluded.",https://fox6now.com/2020/05/19/20-covid-19-cases-linked-to-outbreak-at-dole-plant-in-ohio-according-to-health-officials/,,,"['Money', 'FOX6 Investigators', '2022 Midterm Elections', 'Contact 6', 'Gino At The Movies', 'Wisconsin Badgers', 'Personal Finance', ""Wisconsin's Most Wanted"", 'Recalls', 'Buddy Check 6', 'Beyond The Game', 'Consumer Reports', ""Look Who's 6"", 'Interviews', 'Green Bay Packers', 'Regional News', 'Marquette Golden Eagles', 'Lifestyle', 'Coronavirus', 'Gino at the movies', 'Out and About', 'Milwaukee Bucks', 'High School Hot Shots', 'Entertainment', 'Family', '2022 Wisconsin State Fair', 'Future Forecaster', 'Small Business', 'Food', 'Business', 'Milwaukee Brewers']"

Pulisic was back in Chelsea manager Frank Lampard's XI for the Premier League's first match of 2020, the Blues' 1-1 away draw at Brighton & Hove Albion on Wednesday.

Deployed wide left in Lampard's 4-2-3-1, Pulisic went 66 minutes and left the game with his side in the lead on Cesar Aspilicueta's 10th-minute goal. Brighton eventually leveled the match through Alireza Jahanbaksh's spectacular equalizer, an overhead kick from range.

Lampard had ruled Pulisic out of Chelsea's previous match, a 2-1 come-from-behind win away at London rivals Arsenal, and there appeared to be concerns that a hamstring or groin ailment could keep the winger out several weeks.

However, Pulisic took to Twitter to reveal, at the very least, those concerns were overblown.

Belgian cyclist Victor Campenaerts and Michelle Vorster made easy work of the Nedbank Cycle Challenge in Windhoek yesterday.



Campaenaerts broke away early from the rest of the pack to win in a time of 2 hours, 11 minutes and 35 seconds.



Namibian cyclist Dan Craven beat Martin Freyer in the sprint for second place in a time of 2 hours, 19 minutes. The cyclist said he knew that he was going to win and thus cycled on his pace without any real threat from the rest of the contenders.



Right after the race Campenaerts said he would donate his N$12 000 winnings to the organisation Physically Active Youth (PAY), which he visited last week.



He said he was impressed with the work they are doing and knew from the start that he had to win the race in order to give them the money.



Craven and Freyer also announced at the prize-giving that they would donate their N$9 000 and N$6 000 winnings to the same organisation, which is an after-school centre in Katutura that provides a safe and nurturing learning environment for youngsters from disadvantaged communities.



The women’s 100 km race was easily won by Michelle Vorster (2 hours, 39 minutes, 31 seconds), who also on Saturday won the Nedbank Mountain Bike Challenge.

The Hadid sisters and Kendall Jenner are Selman fans, and RiRi – who gives seriously good sunglasses – has worn her friend’s shades despite designing pairs herself over at Fenty.com. So, does Selman have the same magic touch when it comes to underwear?

“Lingerie is something I’ve always wanted to design,” Selman tells Vogue. “So many of my collections have been influenced and inspired by the detailing and fabrics. It was an easy pairing because Rihanna and I share so many core beliefs: our brands make people feel confident, powerful and joyful.”

The Xclusive 19-piece underwear edit is split into two categories: Locket Down and Down The Aisle. The former is a play on words, but is as literal as it gets, according to the collection notes. Available in a metallic Goji Berry Red and Black Caviar, the vinyl foil spandex sets feature heart-shaped locket and key charm zipper pulls and rose gold hardware for the “bad ass babe”.

Down the Aisle, in contrast, is “deceivingly sweet”, all delicate ruffles and heart trims. Designed to be layered, mixed and matched, the separates have a vintage look, as well as that girl next door aesthetic.

Each set is packaged neatly into a Savage X Fenty Xtra VIP box with a bonus collectors’ Rihanna phone ring. But it will be the campaign faces that sway you to click to buy, rather than the gift. Adesuwa Aighewi, Fiffany Luu, Joan Smalls and Paloma Elsesser are shot by Dennis Leupold in a wildly kitsch bedroom. “I’ve been really fortunate to have people from all different fields wear my brand,” Selman muses of the Adam Selman effect (his sportswear is also seen in gym selfies across Instagram). “I like that my brand is a community, and I think that’s what makes it feel like a ‘cult following’.” Add to that Rihanna’s loyalists across the globe – “She is just miles ahead of the industry, and her dedication and passion is beyond,” says Selman – and the duo is about to Fentify Valentine’s Day.

For true bad gals who are allergic to the Hallmark holiday, the “naughty-but-nice” knickers will be available to buy through spring via additional drops. “Rihanna is the best,” Selman affirms. “Period.”

The Locket Down box, $59.95 (£46), and Down the Aisle box, $39.95 (£30), are available to buy now at Savagex.com

And what better way to do that than with … a list!? Here’s a rundown of 13 albums to look forward to over the next few months, with release dates included when known.

Selena Gomez, “Rare” (Jan. 10)

Selena Gomez will release ""Rare"" on Jan. 10. (Photo: Chris Pizzello, Chris Pizzello/Invision/AP)

The onetime Disney Channel star has never quite gotten the credit she deserves for her adventurous record-making. Sure, her and DJ Snake’s “Taki Taki” was a shameless Latin-pop play complete with a regrettable “fiesta”/”siesta” rhyme. But before that she turned the Talking Heads’ “Psycho Killer” into the sinuous “Bad Liar,” while her last album, 2015’s “Revival,” feels now like a precursor to Billie Eilish’s whispery ASMR-core. Preceded by a No. 1 single in the grandly emotional “Lose You to Love Me,” Gomez’s new one promises more ear-grabbing textures, as well as her intimate thoughts on her breakup with the Weeknd and her recent health troubles (including a much-publicized kidney transplant).

Halsey, “Manic” (Jan. 17)

Heed that album title: Along with the country-ish “Finally / Beautiful Stranger” and the chart-topping EDM ballad “Without Me,” the latest from this style-hopping streaming native features far-flung hookups with Alanis Morissette (a clear influence), Dominic Fike and Suga of BTS (with whom she teamed for last year’s sprightly K-pop hit “Boy With Luv”).

Pop Star Halsey will release a new album ""Manic"" on Jan. 17. (Photo: Matt Winkelmeyer / Getty Images)

Green Day, “Father of All…” (Feb. 7)

The pop-punk veterans will play stadiums this summer as part of a rock’s-not-dead package that also includes Fall Out Boy and Weezer. (Called the Hella Mega Tour, it’s scheduled to stop at Dodger Stadium on July 25.) Yet what’s appealing about the short and snappy songs on Green Day’s 13th studio album is that they sound like they were born in a tiny club.

Tame Impala, “The Slow Rush” (Feb. 14)

In the works since well before his headlining performance at Coachella last year, Kevin Parker’s fourth full-length as Tame Impala is his most painstakingly detailed yet, with trippy guitar lines and delicate vocal melodies over buoyant grooves that reflect his recent studio work with the likes of Mark Ronson and Kali Uchis. You’d call the result obsessive if it didn’t just make you want to dance.

Grimes, “Miss Anthropocene” (Feb. 21)

The Canadian singer and producer has spoken expansively about her oft-delayed follow-up to 2015’s “Art Angels,” most recently saying it’s “about a modern demonology or a modern pantheon where every song is about a different way to suffer,” as she put it in a published conversation with Lana Del Rey. But even Grimes knows that many listeners will be scrutinizing “Miss Anthropocene’s” knotty electronic pop for clues about her unlikely romantic relationship with Tesla’s Elon Musk.

Dua Lipa, “Future Nostalgia”

Last year’s Grammy winner for new artist has had disco and house music on her mind, to judge from “Electricity” and “One Kiss” – a pair of excellent collaborations with Silk City and Calvin Harris, respectively – and from “Don’t Start Now,” the delightfully rubbery lead single from her sophomore solo disc set for release sometime this year. The throwback sound suits Lipa’s throaty vocals, which have grown more soulful since her catchy but faceless 2017 debut.

Ozzy Osbourne, “Ordinary Man”

The 71-year-old heavy-metal pioneer found himself in the middle of the pop conversation last year when Post Malone recruited him for “Take What You Want,” their pitch-perfect power ballad from Malone’s smash “Hollywood’s Bleeding” album. Now, Osbourne is readying a record of his own that he made with Malone’s producer Andrew Watt; bassist Duff McKagan of Guns N’ Roses and Red Hot Chili Peppers drummer Chad Smith are also in the mix.

Young Thug

Hip-hop’s boldest dresser – not to mention one of its most distinctive vocal stylists – has several projects reportedly in the pipeline, including an album with the tantalizing title “Punk” and a full-length collaboration he’s said to have made with Juice Wrld, who died last month at age 21.

Frank Ocean

The elusive R&B auteur hasn’t revealed anything official about his feverishly anticipated follow-up to 2016’s “Blonde.” But if he’s truly set to headline Coachella, as is widely rumored, then Ocean seems all but certain to time his new album to the April mega-festival (as Kendrick Lamar did a few years ago with “Damn”). Then again, Ocean’s recent string of singles led many to expect him to show up at November’s Camp Flog Gnaw Carnival – and we all know how that turned out.

Haim

L.A.’s premier sister trio isn’t making it easy to predict where the three will go on their third studio album. “Summer Girl,” the first of three 2019 singles, was a stripped-down Lou Reed-style jam, while “Now I’m in It” was classic uptempo Haim and “Hallelujah” a folky acoustic tune.

Dixie Chicks, “Gaslighter”

The outspoken country trio – whose last album, “Taking the Long Way,” came out in 2006 (and won Grammys for album, record and song of the year) – returned to the studio in 2019 for a guest appearance on Taylor Swift’s “Lover.” Now they’re working with Swift’s right-hand man, Jack Antonoff, on a divorce-inspired record that lead singer Natalie Maines has described as “10 times” more “personal and autobiographical” than “Taking the Long Way.”

Justin Bieber

With appearances on tracks by a diverse array of acts including Luis Fonsi, DJ Khaled, Ed Sheeran, Gucci Mane, Billie Eilish and Dan & Shay, Bieber hasn’t exactly been hard to hear in the half-decade since his last solo record, 2015’s Christian-themed “Purpose.” But this year, he’ll be nearly impossible to escape, with a comeback single, “Yummy,” set for release on Friday, followed by the late-January premiere of a YouTube reality series, a world tour that kicks off in May and an album that the now-married man says will be “different than the previous albums just because of where I’m at in my life.”

Rihanna

The wait for “R9,” as fans refer with increasing impatience to Rihanna’s upcoming ninth studio album, has become an internet joke – so much so that Rihanna herself got in on it recently with an Instagram post in which the singer (who’s been spending her time on acting, her clothing and beauty lines and a coffee-table book) captioned a video of a dancing puppy like so: “update: me listening to R9 by myself and refusing to release it.”

Obviously, it all means nothing, but it’s a bit of fun to pass the time – and Ruffalo, who plays Hulk in the record-breaking Avengers series, gave it a go.

The actor couldn’t feign his surprise when the Instagram app randomly allocated him... Hulk! (We’re going to hope he’s being genuine and this was the first time he tried).

Shape Created with Sketch. Marvel films – ranked worst to best Show all 23 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch. Shape Created with Sketch. Marvel films – ranked worst to best 1/23 Iron Man 2 23. Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers. Marvel/Disney 2/23 Thor: The Dark World 22. When the Thor franchise lost its director Kenneth Branagh between the first and second films, it also had to kiss goodbye to the Shakespearean theatrics that had lent it a sense of goofy charm. Directed by Game of Thrones’s Alan Taylor, The Dark World prioritises its VFX effects above all else. It’s a dull affair: Christopher Eccleston’s Malekith is (by far) Marvel’s worst villain, being a pile of prosthetics with zero personality, while Chris Hemsworth’s Thor completes one of the most unrealistic London Tube journeys in all of cinematic history. Marvel/Disney 3/23 The Incredible Hulk 21. Edward Norton’s version of the smashing Hulk often gets forgotten by Marvel fans – and for good reason. Whereas Mark Ruffalo’s bumbling interpretation of the character has a gravitational charm, Norton’s moping monster is void of any charisma. With Liv Tyler phoning in her performance as love interest, Betty Ross, the film falls emotionally flat and serves only as a by-the-numbers origins story. Marvel/Disney 4/23 Avengers: Age of Ultron 20. Just in case we’d forgotten that the Disney corporation is an all-consuming titan that owns half of Hollywood, the sequel to 2012’s Avengers decided to sneak in a little corporate synergy: when Iron Man accidentally creates a sentient robot (voiced by James Spader) who decides the earth’s only salvation is through the destruction of humanity, he announces his grim plans with accompaniment of a little citation of the classic “I’ve Got No Strings” from 1940’s Pinocchio. It’s a moment that exemplifies how Ultron feels like a cold, calculated operation from Marvel Studios. It’s merely tick list of obligations to move us on to the next chapter of the MCU. Marvel/Disney 5/23 Thor 19. Although Kenneth Branagh’s introductory outing for Marvel’s God of Thunder fared perfectly well on release, it’s suffered massively from the MCU’s dramatic sense of progression over the years. Certainly, Tom Hiddleston’s Loki is a strong, well-crafted character right out of the gate, and his plot against his adoptive father (Anthony Hopkins) is delightfully heightened. Yet, it arguably took until Thor: Ragnarok for Chris Hemsworth’s hero to develop much sense of character beyond the initial “fish out of water” trope. Marvel/Disney 6/23 Doctor Strange 18. A self-centred wealthy white man ventures to a distant land and realises his superhero potential – sound familiar? That’s because Doctor Strange and Iron Man are basically the same story, except one uses magic and the other explosives. Benedict Cumberbatch’s Marveldebut impresses with kaleidoscope visuals but lacks the heart of Robert Downey Jr’s hero, leading to a film that wastes the talents of both Tilda Swinton and Mads Mikkelsen. Marvel/Disney 7/23 Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2 17. The first Guardians of the Galaxy was a risky Star Wars-inspired romp through space, following a bunch of a-holes who form an unlikely familiar bond. For the second film, James Gunn decided to turn everything up to 11, cramming half a dozen interweaving storylines, leading to Chris Pratt’s gaunt Star Lord getting side-lined. The sequel did, however, introduce the now beloved line “I’m Mary Poppins, y’all”, shouted by Yondu as he gracefully falls from the sky. A wonderfully comedic moment in a film that misses on another half-dozen punches. Marvel/Disney 8/23 The Avengers 16. Marvel’s first crossover film was an unparalleled cinematic event – one that arguably changed Hollywood filmmaking forever, now that every major studio seems to be attempting the “shared universe” approach to franchises. Although the MCU has refined the template since, The Avengers still established the focus on humour, character, and heart that would come to define the success story of Marvel Studios. It’s a blockbuster that feels large on all fronts, delivering thrills not only in the “Battle of New York” finale, but in the creation of a team of characters that feel perfectly balanced and complementary. Marvel/Disney 9/23 Captain America: Civil War 15. Despite Captain America: Civil War (AKA Avengers 2.5) featuring Iron Man, Black Widow, and Ant-Man (as well as introducing Black Panther and Spider-Man), the film remains first and foremost about Captain America. And that’s perhaps why the stuffed blockbuster works – were it not for a central focus, Civil War could have fallen into the trappings of other Marvel sequels in being too convoluted. The Russo Brothers also direct one of the best actions scenes in Marvel history so far, the airport scene, which looks as if it leapt straight out of a comic book. Marvel/Disney 10/23 Ant-Man and the Wasp 14. While the first Ant Man was a mirror image of its star Paul Rudd, essentially delivering a studio comedy dressed in spandex, the second found a new trick up its sleeve in the form of Evangeline Lilly’s Hope van Dyne – a smart, capable female hero who didn’t simply exist to serve as a caretaker for the male characters. Marvel/Disney 11/23 Spider-Man: Far From Home 13. What comes after the end? It’s the question that was hanging over the Marvel Cinematic Universe ever since the release of Avengers: Endgame was sold to us as the ultimate, cumulative chapter in a series of 22 interconnected films. And yet, while Far From Home is distinctly mid-level Marvel fare, there’s a lot to be said for the fact it isn’t crushed under the weight of its own ambitions. It feels comfortably like the end of a chapter, the beginning of a new one, an epilogue, and a palate cleanser all at once. It also works perfectly well as a film about Spider-Man. AP 12/23 Ant-Man 12. Ant-Man should not have worked as a film. Just look at the title! Ridiculous to think a movie about a man with ant powers should work – let alone be a blockbuster success and part of the biggest cinematic universe going. Yet, despite production problems (Edgar Wright was initially meant to helm the film), Peyton Reed directs this hilarious heist film with aplomb, taking the Marvel world a little less seriously than others. Marvel/Disney 13/23 Avengers: Infinity War 11. Marvel redefined cinematic narratives once more in 2018, creating a single culmination to a decade’s worth of films. While it plays as total nonsense to anyone who’s a newcomer to the franchise (if that’s possible), it was, for fans, an unmatched emotional release. The Russo brothers faced the monumental task of making each crossover – from the Guardians of the Galaxy to the kingdom of Wakanda – work in a way that feels natural, while also ushering the MCU’s biggest villain, Thanos, into centre stage. Epic both in its sense of scale and stakes, Infinity War also stages one of the most memorable finales in blockbuster history. Marvel/Disney 14/23 Captain America: The First Avenger 10. With or without the beard, Steve Rogers aka Captain America has now become the brooding centre of the Avengers, but there was once a time when he was all about the old-fashioned heroics. Director Joe Johnston stayed true to the film’s 1940s setting in a film that embraces that pulpiness of early comic book history, as Steve punches Nazis and romances military officer Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), although her character is thankfully never relegated to the role of damsel in distress. Marvel/Disney 15/23 Captain America: The Winter Soldier 9. Despite centring on a super-powered American nationalist, the Captain America trilogy has the most consistent quality in the MCU. Its crowning moment comes with The Winter Soldier – an adrenaline-fuelled conspiracy thriller that features a spectacular twist and provokes questions regarding modern day surveillance. However, given The Russo Brothers root the rest of the movie in realism, the bombastic CGI-heavy ending is a little ridiculous. Marvel/Disney 16/23 Captain Marvel 8. Brie Larson gives a superpowered performance as Carol Danvers, the actor playing a hero that's both relatable and aspirational, strong but vulnerable. While Captain Marvel may not revolutionise the studio’s formula, the superhero's debut outing provides a platform to show off her Thanos-annihilating powers. Thanks to a smart script, it also offers some of the very best character development in the MCU. Marvel/Disney 17/23 Spider-Man: Homecoming 7. While Spider-Man’s miraculous arrival in the MCU came with Captain America: Civil War, it was not until Homecoming that we truly got to know Peter Parker. Tom Holland’s incarnation swings past Andrew Garfield’s version, thanks to the film’s lower-stakes high school story allowing for intimate moments with the character. Along with including some great comic performances (Jacob Batalon as Ned stands out), Michael Keaton’s Vulture makes for a terrifying villain, and the twist is superbly done. Marvel/Disney 18/23 Iron Man 3 6. While divisive among Marvel fans, Shane Black’s superhero outing – with the writer/director’s sharp, stinging dialogue – brings Tony Stark's story arc to an end (or what should have been its end) with humour and heart aplenty. As Robert Downey Jr’s genius, billionaire philanthropist deals with PTSD and struggles with his robotic creations, we see an actor giving his all. While Civil War and the Avengers films dragged him back into action, fingers are crossed Avengers: Endgame will give the character a similar emotionally satisfying send-off. Marvel/Disney 19/23 Avengers: Endgame 5. It’s a film that’s hard to place within the MCU canon, simply because the majority of its emotional pay-offs only work due to the groundwork laid by over a decade of filmmaking. Avengers: Endgame is less about individual storytelling and so much more about the collective experience of cinema itself. This exists to be consumed in the dark, surrounded by loved ones, as you all cheer, gasp, and cry in unison. The fan service at work may, at times, feel a little outrageous in just how bold it feels, but Endgame earns the right to indulge. This, above all, is a celebration of these movies and their impact on the world. AP 20/23 Thor: Ragnarok 4. Completely transforming the Thor franchise in a single, effortless move, director Taika Waititi injected new energy into the MCU. Ragnarok is perfectly balanced both as a standard Marvel movie, with all the right heroics and world-building intact, and as a work belonging exclusively to Waititi, filled with the humour and charm he’d previously displayed in What We Do in the Shadows and Hunt for the Wilderpeople. By finding a way to incorporate individual voices into its massive franchise machine, Marvel found the secret to true long-term success. Marvel/Disney 21/23 Iron Man 3. Where it all started. Iron Man subverted expectations by not only reintroducing Robert Downey Jr to the world, but by showing that a relatively unknown B-character could be at the centre of a blockbuster. Other cinematic universes fail because they attempt to introduce too much (a mistake made in Iron Man 2). The first Iron Man, though, had a self-contained story that only hinted at a bigger world – a world that would eventually become a multi-billion-dollar franchise. Marvel/Disney 22/23 Guardians of the Galaxy 2. Blasting the Marvel universe into space for an adventure with a truly ragtag group of heroes, including both a talking racoon and a sentient tree-creature, Guardians of the Galaxy is arguably the biggest risk the franchise ever took. And it paid off in spectacular fashion, with director James Gunn giving the superhero genre a light coat of B-movie glee. It also transformed Parks and Recreation star Chris Pratt into the major box office draw he is today. Marvel/Disney 23/23 Black Panther 1. Although Black Panther still dutifully fulfils all the requirements of a Marvel film, providing a bridge to films both past and future plus ending in a cinematic battle filled with CGI trickery, Ryan Coogler’s achievement as a director is to use a familiar framework to tell a radical story within mainstream filmmaking. In the strife between Chadwick Boseman’s T’Challa, the ruler of Wakanda, and Michael B Jordan’s Killmonger, he provided a nuanced, layered commentary on colonialism and black identity. It’s a film that triumphs both within its genre, bringing new perspectives to the superhero story, and outside of it, satisfying purely as a piece of narrative drama. Marvel/Disney 1/23 Iron Man 2 23. Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke).

The ramvolution has begun.

A pack of wild goats is horning in on a tiny human community in Wales where the streets have been largely deserted due to the novel coronavirus pandemic.

The seaside resort town of Llandudno is typically rammed with tourists each summer, but the COVID-19 outbreak has forced everyone indoors and left plenty of room for visitors of another kind.

Locals have posted several photos and videos online of roughly a dozen wild Kashmiri mountain goats wandering around downtown Llandudno, where they could be seen hopping on benches and capering around on the pavement over several days.

One video shows the goats treating a retaining wall like a cliff face, standing precariously on the edge while munching on the scruffy grass growing between the stones.

“They are curious, goats are,” town Coun. Carol Marubbi told the BBC. “I think they are wondering what’s going on like everybody else.”

Local reporter and self-described “goat correspondent” Andrew Stuart has been breathlessly covering the story since Saturday through various Twitter yarns threads.

“They’re still here,” he tweeted along with a photo on Tuesday. “They live here now I think.”

“I, for one, welcome our new goat overlords,” Stuart wrote on Monday, in a reference to The Simpsons.

The goats typically live on the nearby Great Orme reserve, but they have been known to seek shelter in town during bad weather, Marubbi told the Evening Standard.

The goats are said to have been introduced to the area back in 1907 after Queen Victoria received them as a gift from the Shah of Persia.

Marubbi says the animals are well-regarded in the community, and there are no plans to call in a goatbuster.

In fact, when it comes to distractions from COVID-19, this one might be the GOAT (greatest of all time) for residents of Llandudno.

“There isn’t anyone else around,” Marubbi said. “So they probably decided they may as well take over.”

Questions about COVID-19? Here are some things you need to know:

Health officials caution against all international travel. Returning travellers are legally obligated to self-isolate for 14 days, beginning March 26, in case they develop symptoms and to prevent spreading the virus to others. Some provinces and territories have also implemented additional recommendations or enforcement measures to ensure those returning to the area self-isolate.

Symptoms can include fever, cough and difficulty breathing — very similar to a cold or flu. Some people can develop a more severe illness. People most at risk of this include older adults and people with severe chronic medical conditions like heart, lung or kidney disease. If you develop symptoms, contact public health authorities.

To prevent the virus from spreading, experts recommend frequent handwashing and coughing into your sleeve. They also recommend minimizing contact with others, staying home as much as possible and maintaining a distance of two metres from other people if you go out.

Oh, pasta. Whether you’re more of a linguini lover or mad for macaroni, there’s really nothing like a hearty helping of the feel-good dish.

You might be prepared to give up a lot for veganuary 2020 – where people try to go vegan for a month – and you might think you can just get away with not sprinkling cheese on top of your beloved pasta, but what is pasta actually made from?

Brace yourself and read on to find out whether or not vegans can eat pasta…

Is pasta vegan?

Like so many things in life, there isn’t a clear yes or no – it depends on the type of pasta you’re eating.

When it comes to pasta, there’s usually two types: fresh pasta and pasta secca (aka dried pasta).

Hnnng (Picture: Getty)

Fresh pasta is usually made and cooked in the same setting and is usually not vegan because it can contain eggs, whereas dry pasta is nearly always vegan.

If you’re making dry pasta for yourself at home, double-check the packaging but you’re most likely not going to fail veganuary as a result.

If you’re eating pasta out at a restaurant, ask if the fresh pasta was made with eggs or oil.

Giving up fresh pasta might be worth it though – especially if you want to boost your erections.

Netflix documentary The Game Changers tested athletes to try out a vegan diet, and by switching to a plant-based diet, their eggplants noticed the difference, standing tall for up to 500% longer in one case.

How is fresh pasta made?

The typical ingredients for fresh pasta include flour, water, salt, and eggs – note that some fresh pasta can be made with oil instead of eggs, but it’s more likely than not to be made with eggs.

First, the flour and salt are mixed together in a mixing bowl before a well is made in the middle of the flour.

This is when the eggs are normally added; they’re cracked right inside the centre of the flour well.

The flour is mixed into the eggs until a dough forms.

Once that’s done, the dough is cut into the pasta shape of choice.

You can buy vegan fresh pasta alternatives from most major supermarkets, including Waitrose’s vegan ravioli and Sainsburys’ non-egg spaghetti and shroomballs.

How is dried pasta made?

The majority of dried pasta, on the other hand, is vegan and made from just two ingredients.

Most mass-produced dried pastas – which you can buy from supermarkets – contain just flour and semolina.

Semolina, derived from a wheat product, is first mixed with water. This mixture then gets processed in bulk quantities by machines creating a sort of dough.

This dough is then pressed through pasta molds to get the intended shape.

(WNCN) – A former North Carolina football player was arrested Wednesday after investigators with the Wake County Sheriff’s Office caught him with a parcel containing marijuana and edible THC products, officials said.

Christopher Hawkins, 37, was seen picking up a package at home on Beargrass Lane earlier Wednesday, the sheriff’s office said.

A search warrant was obtained and the parcel was seized and discovered to contain marijuana and edible THC worth $160,000, the sheriff’s office said.

Hawkins was charged with two counts of possession with intent to sell deliver marijuana, two counts of conspiracy to deliver marijuana, and possession of drug paraphernalia.

Hawkins is also wanted in Georgia for a probation violation for a separate drug-related offense, the sheriff’s office said.

Hawkins was a defensive back for UNC and also played at Marshall. He was a freshman at Chapel Hill in 2001.

He was arrested in 2015 and charged with acting as an agent and violating North Carolina’s law against luring collegiate athletes into contracts.

That included two counts of inducement for providing former UNC player Robert Quinn with $13,700 and helping him sell game-used equipment for another $1,700 in 2010.

Identical twin sisters who had worked as nurses at the same hospital died within days of each other after testing positive for coronavirus.

Katy and Emma Davis, 37, both suffered from underlying health conditions and had been unwell for some time before contracting Covid-19.

Tributes were paid to the pair after Katy died at Southampton General Hospital on Tuesday and Emma died early on Friday morning.

Their sister Zoe Davis told the BBC: “They always said they had come into the world together and would go out together as well.

“There are no words to describe how special they were.”

Katy worked as risk and patient safety lead in child health at University Hospital Southampton (UHS), while Emma was a nurse in the colorectal unit for nine years until 2013.

Paula Head, chief executive at UHS, said: “I want to pay tribute to Katy who sadly passed away on Tuesday.

“Katy has been described by her colleagues where she worked in child health as a nurse people would aspire to be like and that nursing was more than just a job to her.

UHS said that Emma had the same underlying health condition as Katy and had been unwell prior to her admission when she tested positive for Covid-19.

“She sadly also passed away last night and it goes without saying just how devastating and tragic this is for the family and all who knew them,” a spokesperson said.​

They added: “Emma has been described as an excellent nurse who was calm and cheerful and a good leader.

“She was well liked by all and was a valuable member of the team during her time with us.

“We are supporting Katy and Emma’s family as much as we can through this difficult and distressing period.”

At least 90 front line NHS workers, including around 50 nurses, are believed to have died during the coronavirus outbreak.

BENGALURU: The Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro), which failed to land a probe on Moon in its first attempt in September 2019 (Chandrayaan-2), is set to launch Chandrayaan-3 this year. The third Moon mission is estimated to cost more than Rs 600 crore.Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, Isro chairman K Sivan said: “We are looking at a launch this year, but it may spillover to early next year. Chandrayaan-3 will have a lander, rover and a propulsion module given that the Chandrayaan-2 orbiter is fully functional. The government has approved the project and we have formed the project team.”Breaking up the cost, Sivan said that the lander, rover and propulsion module will cost Rs 250 crore, while launch service will cost another Rs 365 crore. “Together the cost would be Rs 615 crore,” he said, while another official told TOI that the internal target set for the crucial launch is November 2020. On Tuesday, agencies quoted Union minister Jitendra Singh saying that the launch will take place this year.TOI was the first to report that Isro had begun work on Chandrayaan-3 and M Vanitha, the project director of Chandrayaan-2 has been transferred making way for P Veeramuthuvel.Confirming this, Sivan said: “It is an Isro team, everybody is from our organisation. Yes, Veeramuthuvel has been identified as the project director. He was also associated with the Chandrayaan-2 mission.”Allaying concerns that big-ticket projects like Chandrayaan-3, Gaganyaan and Aditya (Sun mission) will hamper other missions the space agency has in its pipeline, Sivan said that there is no stress on Isro resources and that work will happen simultaneously.“We are looking at more than 25 missions this year and are confident that each project work will happen simultaneously,” Sivan said.Sivan had, in January 2019, set a target of about 30 missions for the year, but Isro managed only 13. “It was not because we were doing Chandrayaan, but because there was a delay in the supply of equipment needed for satellite missions,” Sivan added.Another senior official said that the Indian industry must improve the quality of electronic equipment to meet the agency’s current demand. “Earlier, we never spoke of numbers, but now we can assure that, and yet, we don’t have a good response from the industry,” the official said.Isro has demanded Rs 14,000 crore in the next budget (2020-21), Sivan said, and added that among the big projects in 2020 are: “Land acquisition for the second spaceport in Tamil Nadu’s Kulasekarapattinam in Tuticorin ... We will need about 2,300 acres for this.”Isro has already requested for Rs 120 crore for a new launchpad for SSLV (small satellite launch vehicle), which will be part of this proposed spaceport. Tamil Nadu government will acquire the land and transfer it to Isro. Sivan also said the first experimental flight of SSLV will happen this year at Sriharikota, while Aditya mission is scheduled for mid-2020.“We’ve also made progress with letting private players build PSLV, and we will enhance their participation even with SSLV,” he said.He added that the international agency regulating use of GPS-like systems in mobile phones has approved NaVIC — India’s own version of GPS — for use in mobiles.“NaVIC will soon be available for mobile phones.

(WWLP) – Ever notice your gym gets busier in January? Getting active is one of the top New Year’s resolutions that people make.

“It’s interesting to watch how many stick with it and are here in February and March. It’s fun to watch them come and go and try and encourage people to do it,” a gym member and Wilbraham resident, Sue Rigney said.

That’s because fitness, in many surveys we saw, was the number one resolution for people in the new year.

Unfortunately, many people end up abandoning the resolution only a few weeks in. According to U.S. News and World Report, the failure rate for resolutions is 80 percent.

“Some people set unrealistic expectations unfortunately sometimes. So it’s good to have a good set one,” Best Fitness front desk employee, Tyler Cote told 22News.

Google Trends shows that searches related to exercise peak around January 1st every year. That’s when gyms also typically see a spike in membership sign-ups.

The International Health, Racquet and Sportsclub Association says 12 percent of new gym memberships happen in January, the most out of any other month.

“I know we’re going to start seeing a lot of new people coming in because you know everyone has their fitness resolutions and once the new year comes everyone’s like let’s get on it. It’s the best time, new year new me,” Cote continued.

Gym staff recommends starting a small goal that you can track for your New Year’s fitness journey to avoid taking on too much, too fast.

But Hopsquad hasn’t let another year go by without opening its doors. In a section of North Austin that has become a hub for breweries, Hopsquad opened for the first time this weekend with four beers on draft in an airy, dog-friendly taproom.

Cousins Alex and Cesar Limon transformed a warehouse, the former site of an office furniture supply company, into Hopsquad — just about next door to Circle Brewing and a quick drive to other area breweries such as 4th Tap Brewing Co-op, Oskar Blues and Celis Brewery. The new beer maker is easily visible from Braker Lane thanks to a facade completely covered in art by David Rocha.

Hopsquad aims to stand out in a crowded local market by turning its brews into memorable characters such as the Lord Zanate IPA and Dutchess of Oltorf Holiday Roggenbier, both of which are on the opening beer list. All four current options are $5. Other beverages available include a cider from the neighboring Fairweather Cider and one red, white, rosé and sparkling wine each.

A food truck, Tsuke Honten, is permanently on-site as the Asian fusion vision of chef Michael Che, who previously worked at two stellar sushi spots in Austin, Soto and Kyoten Sushiko, according to his bio on the food truck’s website.

Check out Hopsquad at 2307 Kramer Ln. during the current taproom hours: 3 to 9 p.m. Wednesday and Thursday, 12 to 10 p.m. Friday and Saturday, and 12 to 6 p.m. Sunday.

This calls for a celebratory plié. A press release announced that Amazon Studios and Anonymous Content have kicked off principal photography on Smith’s “Birds of Paradise.” Kristine Froseth (“The Assistant”) and Diana Silvers (“Booksmart”) star in the feature.

An adaptation of A.K. Small’s 2019 novel “Bright Burning Stars,” “Birds of Paradise” takes place at “a prestigious ballet school in Paris, where the new girl (Silvers) befriends a grieving dance prodigy (Froseth) as the dancers compete for the school’s ultimate prize: to receive a contract to join the Parisian Opera’s ballet company,” the pic’s synopsis details. “As the pressure mounts and the girls are pushed to their physical and emotional limits, their bond is tested and they’re forced to ask themselves just how far they are willing to go to win.”

Smith, who signed a first-look deal with Amazon Studios last year, penned the script.

“Sarah is a talented, visionary filmmaker who we’re so happy is part of the Amazon family, and we can’t wait to bring her next story to life with ‘Birds of Paradise,'” said Julie Rapaport, Co-head of Movies at Amazon Studios. “We’re also thrilled to be working with stars Diana Silvers and Kristine Froseth who are both on the path to becoming the next household names with their undeniable talents.”

Added Smith, “I wrote these roles specifically for Kristine Froseth and Diana Silvers, who I believe are going to take the world by storm. I’m honored to take this journey with them and so thrilled to be partnering with Amazon Studios once again in pursuit of bold, unapologetic filmmaking.”

Smith’s debut feature, 2014’s “The Midnight Swim,” took home the breakthrough audience award from AFI Fest. Her follow-up, 2016’s Rami Malek-starrer “Buster’s Mal Heart,” premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival. On the small screen, her credits include “Hanna,” “Legion,” and “Room 104.”

“I suspect that directing movies might be a lot like being a professional athlete,” Smith told us. “You have to keep your head in the game and your eye on the ball. And you can’t waste time mourning losses or celebrating wins — at least not until the game is over. Stamina, patience, precision of judgment — these are all the things I love about the job!”

When asked what advice she’d give other women directors, she said, “I would tell them to do things their own way and don’t feel like you ever have to conform to the system, because the system was largely built by men. We need to take all the good lessons from the past and from those existing systems but also not be afraid to make our own rules,” she emphasized.",https://womenandhollywood.com/sarah-adina-smith-directing-ballet-drama-birds-of-paradise-kristine-froseth-diana-silvers-star/,,,"['Sarah Adina Smith', 'Kristine Froseth', 'Women Writers', 'Diana Silvers', 'Amazon', 'Women Directors']"

That includes cash and all kinds of other surfaces that people normally touch. So certainly with the coronavirus, cash handling is a concern.""

Some businesses are refusing to accept currency, with while several countries have urged their citizens to stop using banknotes altogether.

Open Books, a non-profit bookstore in Chicago, sent an email to customers last week asking individuals not to use cash. A chain of diners in Washington State has also stopped accepting cash. And delivery services like Grubhub, Door Dash and others have instituted ""no contact"" deliveries, and have either stopped offering cash as a payment option or are actively discouraging it.

Even the Federal Reserve has taken efforts to make sure the nation's money supply isn't contaminated. Banknotes that circulated in Europe and Asia are being quarantined for seven to 10 days as a ""precautionary measure,"" according to a Fed spokesperson.

While cash does carry some risk of passing on the virus, it is smaller than other transmission routes. A scientific paper published early in the outbreak found the virus can live on cardboard for up to 24 hours and up to three days on plastic and stainless steel. The researchers, however, did not test whether it can live on banknote paper.

Meanwhile, the mere presence of live virus particles on banknotes does not mean they are a health hazard, public health experts said. Virus particles are unlikely to return to the air, or aerosolize, once on a surface.

""It's not impossible that there might be traces of virus on dollar bill, but if you wash your hands it should provide adequate protections — you shouldn't need anything else,"" Julie Fischer, a professor at the Center for Global Health Science and Society at Georgetown University, said on C-SPAN.

Other devices used to pay for items are just as likely to be vectors for disease transfer. Credit and debit cards are made of plastic and metal. ATMs are touched by hundreds of human hands a day. And studies show smartphones are heavily contaminated with bacteria because of their constant use.

Banknote avoidance isn't just happening in the U.S. In South Korea, which has been more successful in stemming the coronavirus outbreak, the country's central bank took all banknotes out of circulation for two weeks and, in some cases, burned paper money.

Iran is suffering the worst outbreak of the virus in the Middle East. Using cash there is common, but in recent weeks many people have avoided it and banks have announced that they will not accept cash from customers. Iranians often have multiple debit cards but cash is widely used in small-scale transactions, like buying bread in bakeries or leaving a tip. Many people have started even being careful in how they hand over debit cards, as contactless payment methods haven't caught on there.

In the U.S., there is concern that going cash-free shuts out millions of Americans who lack bank accounts or access to financial services like credit cards.

""Not everyone has a bank account, and there are some very important equity issues if we start encouraging cashless transactions,"" said Dr. Danielle Ompad, an epidemiologist at New York University's School of Global Public Health.

""Some people don't have a choice, so to say, 'You should only use cashless transactions,' is not sensitive to their circumstances,"" she said.",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cash-paper-money-coronavirus-covid-19/,,,['COVID-19']

The six-year wait for “Star Wars: The Clone Wars” Season 7 is nearly over. The first episode of the series’ final season will premiere on Disney+ on Friday, February 21, and Disney has unveiled a new clip and several images to hype up the beginning of the end.

Like the show itself, Season 7 will focus on the end of the galaxy-spanning Clone Wars that defined much of the franchise’s mythology. The new clip from “The Bad Batch” teases a team-up with a squad of “favorably mutated” clone troopers, who will kick off the season with a mission behind Separatist lines.

Per Disney: “The forces of darkness have amassed great power in their bid to transform the Republic into the Galactic Empire. With the Republic on a losing streak, Captain Rex fears the Separatists are using stolen data to help predict the Grand Army’s every move. As the threat of defeat looms, Rex teams up with experimental Clone Force 99, also known as the Bad Batch. Together, they embark on a high-risk mission behind enemy lines to uncover the truth behind the Separatist victories.”

While the series’ new clip is focused on the Clone Troopers, plenty of fan-favorite Force users will be returning throughout the upcoming season, including Anakin Skywalker, Darth Maul, and Ahsoka Tano.

Disney

“The Bad Batch” was intended to kick off Season 7 several years ago before production on the series was stopped. The episode would’ve been part of a four-episode arc. One of the series’ writers released plot details about the story arc in 2014, when the series’ future was uncertain — and unfinished story reels were also released — but only time will tell how the experimental Clone Troopers play into the overall series.

The seventh season of “The Clone Wars” will premiere a few months after Dave Filoni’s Disney+ tentpole “The Mandalorian” hit the streamer. Filoni served as creator and showrunner on “Star Wars Rebels” and is the showrunner for “The Clone Wars.” Like his animated series, “The Mandalorian,” which will return for a second season in October, enjoyed stellar fan reception.

“The Mandalorian” Season 1 finale teased that the Darksaber, a black-bladed lightsaber that originated in “The Clone Wars,” would play a significant role in future installments. Given the interconnected nature of recent “Star Wars” projects — and Disney’s need to keep the franchise in the public eye — don’t be surprised if similar teases pop up in the upcoming “The Clone Wars” season.

Michigan Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s administration has requested an emergency supply of the drugs President Trump touted as having success treating patients with severe symptoms of the novel coronavirus, in a reversal from the state's directive to medical professionals last week to avoid the medication for this purpose.

Michigan, this week, requested hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine from the Strategic National Stockpile for physicians to use to help treat patients with COVID-19, after the Food and Drug Administration over the weekend granted an emergency use authorization for the anti-malarial drugs.

FDA OKs EMERGENCY AUTHORIZATION OF DRUGS TOUTED BY TRUMP TO FIGHT COVID-19

But last week, Whitmer’s administration threatened physicians prescribing the drugs, saying they were subject to “administrative action” should they continue to use the medication.

“The Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs has received multiple allegations of Michigan physicians inappropriately prescribing hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine to themselves, family, friends, and/or coworkers without a legitimate medical purpose,” Deb Gagliardi, the director of the Bureau of Professional Licensing, and Forrest Pasanski, the director of the Enforcement Division, wrote in a letter to “licensed prescribers and dispensers.”

“Prescribing hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine without further proof of efficacy for treating COVID-19 or with the intent to stockpile the drug may create a shortage” for those patients who need the drug for its approved use, adding that “reports of this conduct will be evaluated and may be further investigated for administrative action.

“Again, these drugs have not been proven scientifically or medically to treat COVID-19.”

“Michigan pharmacists may see an increased volume of prescriptions for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine and should take special care to evaluate the prescriptions’ legitimacy,” they continued, warning again that “licensed health professionals are required to report inappropriate prescribing practices.”

Michigan wasn’t the only state last week to threaten physicians using the drugs—Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak’s administration also restricted the prescription of the medication, after a man died and his wife was hospitalized for using a fish tank cleaning additive with a similar name as a substitute.

""While the two drugs have necessary medical purposes, there is no conclusive evidence at this time among COVID-19 experts or Nevada's own medical health advisory team that the drugs provide treatment for COVID-19 patients,"" Sisolak said in a statement last week.

But Michigan reversed course, requesting a supply of the medications for physicians to use in treating patients of COIVD-19, after the Department of Health and Human Services received and accepted donations of the medications to the national stockpile to be used for coronavirus treatment.

“President Trump is taking every possible step to protect Americans from the coronavirus and provide them with hope,” HHS Secretary Alex Azar said in a statement. “Scientists in America and around the world have identified multiple potential therapeutics for COVID-19, including chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine.”

He added: “The President’s bold leadership and the hard work of FDA and HHS’s Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response have succeeded in securing this large donation of medicine. We’ll continue working around the clock to get American patients access to therapeutics that may help them battle COVID-19, while building the evidence to evaluate which options are effective.”

The FDA’s emergency use authorization allows hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate products donated to the national stockpile “to be distributed and prescribed by doctors to hospitalized teen and adult patients with COVID-19, as appropriate, when a clinical trial is not available or feasible.”

WHITMER SAYS STATES ARE IN A BIDDING WAR OVER MEDICAL SUPPLIES AMID CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC

Hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate are oral prescription drugs approved to treat malaria and other diseases. HHS says there currently are no approved treatments for COVID-19, but that both drugs have “shown activity in laboratory studies against coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).”

“Anecdotal reports suggest that these drugs may offer some benefit in the treatment of hospitalized COVID-19 patients,” HHS said in a statement. “Clinical trials are needed to provide scientific evidence that these treatments are effective.”

Meanwhile, Whitmer, who has been a fierce critic of the president, said last week that states are being forced to bid with one another for personal protective equipment (PPE) and, in some cases, contracts in place have been set aside, delayed or canceled and the goods are instead going to the federal government.

“We the states are trying to actively get every piece of PPE that we can. We're bidding against one another and, in some cases, the federal government is taking priority,” she said.

Whitmer added: “We've got to keep working to get all of these other pieces of equipment and when we're bidding against one another, it's creating a lot of frustration and concern.”

As of Thursday morning, the U.S. reported more than 216,700 positive cases of COVID-19 and more than 5,130 deaths.

No Lou Williams. No Terance Mann.

Yes, Derrick Walton Jr.

The 6-foot point guard from Michigan — via the Miami Heat, Chicago Bulls, Lithuanian club Zalgiris Kaunas and Germany’s Alba Berlin — finished 2019 by further ingratiating himself with Clippers’ fandom and his teammates alike.

Walton, 24, chalked up a career-high 10 points on 4-of-5 shooting to buoy the short-handed Clippers on Tuesday in a convincing 105-87 victory over the Sacramento Kings.

“Yessssir boyyy hooping,” tweeted Beverley, who missed the first of what’s expected to be a few games with a sprained right wrist.

Walton was, indeed, hooping: He curled comfortably around a Montrezl Harrell screen and sank a jumper; he buried a wide-open rainbow 3-pointer from the top of the arc; he buried another in a defender’s face; he recovered after being blocked by Bogdan Bogdanovic by popping up for another two points from the elbow — and looked exceedingly comfortable all the while.

“He’s just solid, he knows he can score, he knows he can shoot the ball,” coach Doc Rivers told reporters in Sacramento who asked about Walton, who once scored 41 points in a G League game for the Sioux Falls Skyforce.

“It’s like the league doesn’t know he can do that so they’re going to keep leaving him open. He’s not going to hesitate.”

Walton isn’t the flinching type. During his televised postgame interview with Fox Sports’ Kristina Pink, he answered a question about what he’s looking forward to in the new year — which tips off for the Clippers (24-11) on Thursday against the 12-22 Detroit Pistons (7:30 p.m., Fox Sports Prime Ticket) and former Clippers star Blake Griffin, who’s been nursing a sore knee.

“Just being a part of something special,” Walton told Pink in response to her question. “We’re preparing for something big. But you try to take it a day at a time…”

At that point, veteran forward Moe Harkless interrupted, draping a towel over Walton’s head and giving the guard an affectionate noogie — which did not derail Walton’s train of thought: “… and know we got an end goal and just try to build blocks to make sure, at the end of the day, we’re most prepared for what we’re trying to get accomplished.”

Before Walton was called up from Ontario to join the L.A. Clippers on Dec. 1, Walton was preparing for his current opportunity by stuffing stat sheets in the G League, with 13.4 points, 7.2 assists 6.4 rebounds and 1.4 steals in his five games with Agua Caliente.

Now, in 17 contests with L.A., he’s shooting an 55.6 percent from the field, 47.1 percent from 3-point range and is one of six regular Clippers with a positive — plus 1.2 — net plus-minus (the net point differential per 100 offensive and defensive possessions).

Just before this season began, Walton offered a hint of what he believed he could contribute.

“I feel like I’m always silently confident,” he said. “Everything about this situation is about fitting and opportunities.”

Adjusting your skincare routine to your skin type is significant to finding a workable routine: normal, oily, combination or dry. Likewise, it's similarly important to base it on your skin tone or color.

According to the American Academy of Dermatology, for example, people with darker skin tones face a unique set of skincare needs.

Without proper hydration, dry skin can look gray and ashy.

Hyperpigmentation — the overproduction of melanin in the skin — can be caused by UV rays and is probably the most common concern for people of color.

the overproduction of melanin in the skin — can be caused by UV rays and is probably the most common concern for people of color. Post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation — wherein healing skin overproduces melanin — can leave a dark scar where a blemish once lived.

Having said that, there is a slew of skincare products that can help promote healthier skin. To best protect, nourish and treat skin of color, we consulted doctors and experts on some of the best products to get you through your skincare routine.We sorted them through the six essential skincare ingredients experts recommended:

Best SPF skincare for dark skin

Every single dermatologist we consulted emphasized the importance of using sunscreen to promote skin health. Sounds obvious, right? People with darker skin are often told they don’t need sunscreen, which is a deeply incorrect and potentially dangerous piece of advice.

“Daily SPF — at least 30 — is critical for prevention and treatment of hyperpigmentation, as well as for prevention of skin cancer,” Sara Perkins, MD, an assistant professor with the Department of Dermatology at the Yale School of Medicine, told NBC News. “This is an absolute must for all skin types, including skin of color.”

Perkins, who’s also the clinical advisor to Hims and Hers, considers EltaMD's SPF offerings her “top choice.”

This tinted, mineral sunscreen protects your skin from damaging UVA and UVB rays to prevent early signs of aging and burning.

Hyaluronic acid is the hero ingredient in this moisturizer that doubles as a broad-spectrum sunscreen.

For those prone to acne or hyperpigmentation, this sunscreen includes niacinamide (Vitamin B3), hyaluronic acid, and antioxidants — which we'll dive into below. Perkins gave an honorable mention to La Roche Posay Anthelios facial sunscreen, as well.

Jared Jagdeo, MD, a board-certified dermatologist and Ever/Body’s medical director, recommended SkinCeuticals’ take on SPF.

“This product is outstanding, blends in perfectly to any skin tone and never leaves that chalky look,” said Jagdeo, who added that what really makes for a great sunscreen is your desire to use it everyday.

This sunscreen is beloved by dermatologists because it was formulated to be fail-proof. “This specific sunscreen was studied in the real world and shown to be more effective in preventing sunburn as compared to sunscreens with lower SPF levels,” Joshua Zeichner, MD, director of cosmetic and clinical research at Mount Sinai Hospital's dermatology department, told NBC News.

Best retinol skincare for dark skin

Retinol is pretty much the gold standard when it comes to anti-aging skincare.

""This vitamin A derivative truly has clinically-proven anti-aging properties — but it can also help with pigmentation,” Perkins explained. “It's also very effective in the treatment of acne. These can be quite irritating so I recommend starting with the lower concentrations first.”

As with any skincare product, it comes down to how you use it, and when. Over-the-counter retinols are best used in the evening. Irritation and dryness are common side effects. Pairing a retinol product with a moisturizer can help avoid some of that, Perkins said. Or you can use a gentle retinol oil like MARA Evening Primrose Green Tea Algae Retinol Face Oil.

“This budget-friendly night treatment contains both alpha hydroxy acids, which help to unstick and exfoliate dulling, dead skin cells immediately, as well as retinol, which stimulates cell turnover and new collagen production over time,” Tsippora Shainhouse, MD, a dermatologist in Los Angeles, told NBC News. “Together, these help to reduce the appearance of fine lines with regular use over two to three months.”

The combo of retinol and hyaluronic acid is what makes this one a game-changer. “This retinoid serum visibly fills and reduces wrinkles, giving skin a smoother and more plumped appearance,” says Howard Sobel, MD, New York City dermatologist and founder of Sobel Skin.

Best skincare with hyaluronic acid

Another significant ingredient in skincare for most skin types is hyaluronic acid, “a natural sugar molecule that occurs in our body and helps to attract water, so it functions as a great moisturizer,” said Marisa Garshick, MD, a dermatologist at Medical Dermatology & Cosmetic Surgery in New York City.

“It keeps the skin looking fresh and hydrated,"" Garshick told NBC News.

“In darker skin tones, dryness frequently manifests as an ashy or grayish appearance of the skin,” dermatologist Joshua Zeichner, MD, told NBC News. “Hyaluronic acid is a go-to ingredient to pump all skin types, and is particularly useful in those with darker skin. It acts like a sponge binding to 1000 times its weight in water.”

And let’s not forget dark skinned men who, yes, also need to take care of their skin. Jagdeo recommends the DefenAge Men's Kit, its key ingredients including a proprietary peptide blend, along with soothing niacinamide and hyaluronic acid, designed to help users achieve a smooth, well-hydrated and improved complexion.

He says it’s “ideal for the man who wants to look his best with an easy-to-use, all-in-one regimen,” adding that the “comprehensive kit addresses most skin concerns.”

Best skin brightening products

A lot of serums formulated to brighten skin also have the bonus effect of treating hyperpigmentation and dark spots.

Zeichner recommended Neutrogena’s Bright Boost Serum. “Pigmentary disorders are extremely common among patients with darker skin types,” he explained. “Turmeric extract has long been used in skin care because of its ability to brighten unwanted pigmentation and even skin tone.”

Bradley Bloom, MD, of Laser & Skin Surgery Center of New York, recommended SkinMedica Lytera 2.0 Pigment Correcting Serum. “It combines some of the most effective brightening ingredients, including niacinamide, in a non-irritating formula,” he said.

Jagdeo said he recommends SkinCeuticals Discoloration Defense for one specific reason: “Discoloration defense is specially formulated with a combination of anti-pigment agents designed to even out the tone of the skin.”

Best skincare with antioxidants

Another heavily recommended ingredient by the dermatologists we consulted: antioxidants. To briefly summarize: ""Antioxidant serums help protect your skin from the free radicals you're exposed to on a daily basis. They also aid in the prevention of fine lines and other visible signs of aging, and can heal and repair skin,"" Dr. Debra Jaliman, a board-certified dermatologist in New York City and author of the book ""Skin Rules: Trade Secrets From a Top New York Dermatologist,"" told NBC News.

Sapna Palep, MD, of Spring Street Dermatology recommended the ALASTIN Restorative Skin Complex. ""It’s chock full of potent antioxidants to help even skin tone while also plumping the skin and combating fine lines and wrinkles.” Palep explained. ""It’s so versatile for all skin tones, including darker complexions.”

Hadley King, a board certified dermatologist, is a fan of The Everything Oil. “It contains cold pressed, organic prickly pear seed oil, organic avocado oil, organic sweet almond oil and organic aloe vera. These ingredients both hydrate and moisturize, and they have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties as well. And it's vegan, organic and cruelty-free and it's formulated without water, alcohol or silicone. It's also a great option for brightening, which is often a plus for dark skin tones. The ingredients work together to brighten the skin by offering antioxidant protection, anti-inflammatory properties, increased cell turnover, hydration and increased collagen production. There are no potentially irritating ingredients to lead to post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation.”

Best Vitamin C-infused skincare

Vitamin C, or L-ascorbic acid, is a substantial antioxidant that stimulates collagen production and fights UV damage and pigmentation — not to mention helps stave off colds. You can get your Vitamin C from certain foods — or you can wear it on your face.

“Formulation, packaging and storage are key here as it oxides quickly when exposed to light,” Perkins said about what readers should keep in mind. Vitamin C can go from useable to dysfunction seemingly overnight.

Both Jagdeo and Palep recommended the C E Ferulic serum, which Jagdeo uses for both himself and his clients, and called “the hero product by which the rest of the cosmeceutical industry is measured.”

It’s an investment — one Palep said is worth it, as it remains active for multiple days and the included dropper keeps you using precisely how much you need to with little waste.

“It’s packed with antioxidants that work great on darker skin tones for brightening and destroying free radicals,” she added.

King recommends Schaf Revitalizing Serum, which was formulated specifically for dark spots and fine lines, making it a great fit for dark skin tones.

“Vitamin C boosts brightness through its antioxidant properties, hyaluronic acid hydrates the skin, and peptides help stimulate collagen production to diminish fine lines,” she said. It’s also vegan and cruelty free.

The President of the Republic, Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, says investor confidence in Ghana’s economy is growing following the competent management of the economy exhibited since 2017.

According to President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, “in three years we have reduced inflation to its lowest level (7.8% in January 2020) since 1992. For the first time in over forty (40) years, we have had a fiscal deficit below five per cent (5%) of GDP for three years in a row.”

Additionally, the President, Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, indicated that “for the first time in over twenty (20) years, the balance of trade (that is the difference between our exports and imports) has been in surplus for three (3) consecutive years. Our current account deficit is shrinking, interest rates are declining, and the average annual rate of depreciation of the cedi is at its lowest for any first-term government in the Fourth Republic.”

He made this known on Thursday, 20th February, 2020, when he delivered a Message on the State of the Nation, in Parliament.

Economic growth, President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo said, has rebounded to place Ghana among the fastest growing economies in the world for three years in a row at an annual average of 7%, up from 3.4% in 2016, the lowest in nearly three decades.

“The international investor community has recognised this development, resulting in Ghana, today, being the largest recipient of foreign direct investment in West Africa. The sovereign credit rating agencies have upgraded our ratings, and also improved the outlook for this year, notwithstanding the fact that it is an election year,” he said.

President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo added, “This is a massive vote of confidence in the current management of the economy, as best illustrated by Ghana’s successful issue of the longest-dated Eurobond ever issued by a sub-Saharan African country, with investors placing fifteen billion United States dollars ($15 billion) of orders for Ghana’s forty-one (41) year Eurobond.”

The seven (7) year Bond, he explained, attracted the lowest coupon rates ever for Ghana at 6.375%, compared with the 9.25% Ghana had to pay for a similar Eurobond issue in 2016.

“No wonder Bloomberg, the reputable global financial media house, earlier this week, highlighted Ghana as the top candidate for an economic leap in Africa. This expression of confidence is important because it will lead to enhanced investments in our economy, and the accompanying greater numbers of jobs,” he added.",https://www.ghanamma.com/2020/02/21/investor-confidence-in-ghanas-economy-growing-akufo-addo/,,,

BBC has axed The Greatest Dancer after just two series, with falling viewing figures being blamed for its demise.

The show made its debut at the start of last year, with Cheryl, Strictly star Oti Mabuse and Glee actor Matthew Morrison as its dance captains.

The Greatest Dancer returned to screens in January, with new recruit Todrick Hall joining the panel, but why it still had a loyal following, it failed to set Saturday night prime time ratings alight.

The second series, which ended in March, attracted around 3.2 million viewers week on week, significantly lower than ITV rival The Masked Singer, which has been confirmed for a second run.

A TV source told The Sun:: “The writing was on the wall a while back.

“Now the BBC and everyone involved has decided enough is enough and they’ve binned it.

“Critics liked it and it pulled in a younger audience. But the cost of the big production for the ratings the show delivered was too much.”

A BBC spokesperson confirmed The Greatest Dancer wouldn't be renewed, saying: ""Whilst there are no plans for a further series of The Greatest Dancer, we are proud of the show,

2325,1571178629,['Adina Genn'],"Where’s my $1,200?",en,,,,"How to access payments, and what the money means to the region.","That $1,200 from the U.S. government is expected to arrive to households across the nation within the next three weeks.

These payments are part of the $2.2 trillion rescue package signed into law last week to spur the economy, which screeched to a halt in the COVID-19 pandemic.

But questions remain as to how to access that $1,200, and if that money is enough to provide a much-needed assist as millions of Americans are now filing for unemployment.

And while $1,200 might help alleviate some financial pressure for Long Islanders, the plan shows a “failure to recognize the regional cost differences” across the nation, said Lawrence Levy, the executive dean of suburban studies at Hofstra University, where he is also vice president for economic development and professional studies. In addition, Levy heads up Ascend Long Island, a pilot program that supports underserved communities in Nassau County.

Levy said that “$1,200 doesn’t go nearly as far in Hempstead as it does in Huntsville, Alabama. The help is not going to go as far here as it will in other parts of the country.” It’s disappointing, he said, as “the federal government does recognize” the cost of living difference in how it pays its employees based on where they live.

The $1,200 per taxpayer is “punishing to the higher costs suburbs all around the country,” he said.

Meanwhile, to access that money, most people don’t need to do anything. But some, including senior citizens and low-income people who might not traditionally file tax returns, are advised to take action. People behind on filing their taxes might also want to get caught up.

Eligibility

Anyone earning up to $75,000 in adjusted gross income and who has a Social Security number will receive a $1,200 payment. That means married couples filing joint returns will receive the full payment — $2,400 — if their adjusted gross income, which is what you report on your taxes, is under $150,000.

The payment steadily declines for those who make more. Those earning more than $99,000, or $198,000 for joint filers, are not eligible. The thresholds are slightly different for those who file as a head of household.

Parents will also receive $500 for each qualifying child.

Accessing funds

Most people don’t have to do anything to access the funds.

The money will be directly deposited in your bank account if the government has that information from your tax return. If you haven’t filed your 2019 taxes, the government will use information from your 2018 taxes to calculate your payment and determine where to send it. It can use your Social Security benefit statement as well.

If you don’t usually have to file taxes

People who are not required to file a tax return — such as low-income tax payers, some senior citizens, Social Security recipients, some veterans and people with disabilities — will need to file a very simplified tax return to receive the economic impact payment. It provides the government basic details including a person’s filing status, number of dependents and direct-deposit bank information.

If you didn’t yet file 2018 or 2019 taxes

You will still get a payment, but the IRS urges anyone required to file a tax return and has not yet done so for those years to file as soon as possible in order to receive an economic impact payment. Taxpayers should include their direct-deposit banking information on the return if they want it deposited in their account.

If you don’t use direct deposit on your taxes

The government will default to sending you the check by mail if you did not use direct deposit.

However, IRS and Treasury say that they will develop an online portal in the coming weeks for individuals to provide their banking information so that they can receive the payments immediately instead of in the mail. It has not yet set a deadline for updating that information.

Learning more about the check

The IRS and Treasury say the website irs.gov/coronavirus will soon provide information about the check, including how people can file a simple 2019 tax return.

When you need more time to file your tax returns

The IRS says people concerned about visiting a tax professional or local community organization in person to get help with a tax return should not worry. The economic impact payments will be available throughout the rest of 2020.

Android phones running 6.0 Marshmallow or newer will get the updates.,"Google has confirmed that it will use the Google Play Services infrastructure to update Android phones with the upcoming COVID-19 contact tracing system it is building in collaboration with Apple. It should ensure that more Android phones will actually get the updates, and also ensure that they become available on phones running Android 6.0 Marshmallow or above.

Until today, it was an open question, but one that was vital for Google to answer. That’s because Google Play is the only reliable system that exists for getting software updates pushed out to Android phones in a timely manner. The other way — full operating system updates — is often fraught with delays from both carriers and manufacturers.

Google says that its update system will apply to both phases of the Bluetooth contact tracing framework — the initial API rollout, which is due next month, and the next stage, which will see the APIs built into the OS. The companies will say only that the second stage will arrive “in coming months.”

There is one huge set of Android devices that don’t benefit from Google Play services: all of the Android phones in China, as well as any Huawei phones sold around the world after the imposition of restrictions by the US. Google is not allowed to export software to Huawei, which means it could not apply this system to its phones just as it cannot include Chrome or Gmail.

For those phones, Google intends to publish a framework that those companies could use to replicate the secure, anonymous tracking system developed by Google and Apple. It will then be up to Huawei, Xiaomi, and other Chinese manufacturers (or the Chinese government) to decide whether to use the system.

That’s the strategy Google uses for its Project Mainline system of updates, launched last year for more recent versions of Android. However, Project Mainline updates are explicitly open sourced. Google declined to comment on whether this system would be, but did note that it will offer code audits to companies that want to adopt a similar system.",https://web.archive.org/web/20220620223421id_/https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/13/21220033/android-covid-19-tracking-updates-google-play-contact-tracing,,,

Find out his first words to Meghan Markle and Prince Harry.,"Meghan Markle and Prince Harry are both passionate activists, not least because of the world in which they want their baby son Archie to grow up. At 12 months old, Archie is getting bigger every day and growing into a toddler with likes and dislikes, favorite songs and books and colors, and a whole little internal world. While it seems like just yesterday that Meghan was refusing to pose on church steps with newborn Archie (iconic), the truth is that baby Archie isn’t such a baby anymore. In fact, this royal tot is even talking now — and his first words to Meghan and Harry prove Archie’s got everything he needs at home.

A source close to the couple told Us Weekly that Archie started talking while the Sussexes have been staying in LA. “He’s saying a few words, like ‘Dada,’ ‘Mama,’ ‘book,’ and ‘dog,'” says the source — all of which make perfect sense. After all, it’s well-known that Archie is “best friends” with Meghan and Harry’s two dogs, Guy the beagle and a black Labrador.

It seems Archie’s an avid reader too (well, listener). For his birthday, mom Meghan read him one of his favorites, Duck! Rabbit!, and the source reveals he’s picking up some new hobbies too: “He loves playing hide-and-seek and using building blocks.”

He’s growing up so fast — and we’re sure Meghan and Harry feel the same way. Given his incredible, history-making parents, Archie has a bright future. Those building blocks are just the beginning.

The PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X are coming, some long-awaited titles like The Last of Us Part II and Final Fantasy VII Remake will finally arrive, and cloud gaming and other new ways to play will continue to make inroads. 2020 is going to be a year of transition and upheaval for our hobby, which means it’s a great time for all good little gamers to turn over a new leaf. To make some New Year’s resolutions that will improve your own situation and the gaming scene as a whole.

Of course, sometimes it’s tough to come up with good resolutions, so I’m here to help! Here are a few 2020 gaming resolution suggestions to get your minds percolating…

The Financial Year in Tech 2019: Highs, Lows, and Future Trends

Slim Down Your Backlog in January and February

It’s time to put your pile of shame on a diet. 2020 will eventually see some big releases, with March and April being particularly crazy, but the first two months of the year? Those are unusually barren, so it’s time to finally finish up some of those games that have been lingering for weeks, months, or even years. Personally, I’m finally going to see the end of Red Dead Redemption 2. It, uh, all turns out great, right?

Truly Master at Least One Game

While that aforementioned March-April period will be out of control (get ready for Final Fantasy VII Remake, Cyberpunk 2077, Resident Evil 3, and Animal Crossing: New Horizons, and more within the span of weeks) but, overall, 2020 is a transition year. Things will probably be a bit slower than usual, particularly if you don’t pick up a PS4 or Xbox Series X (we’ll talk about that later). That means, instead of increasing your pile of shame, 2020 is a great year to really drill down and master something. Really become good at a fighting or action game or 100 percent that new RPG. It’s more satisfying to master one game than half-finish a half dozen, and your bank account will thank you.

Stop Fighting Steam and Epic’s Battles for Them

Thankfully, it already seems to be dying down a bit, but the Steam vs. Epic Games Store Wars were the most pointless thing we devoted our time to in 2019. These massively-profitable companies don’t need you fighting their battles for them. Downloading an extra launcher is not a huge imposition, and we’re finally starting to see some real, consumer-benefitting competition, with both Steam and Epic offering some great promotions this holiday season.

Arise: A Simple Story Review – A Good Life, A So-So Video Game

I’d say you should all give up your console and NVIDIA vs. AMD wars as well, but I’m trying to keep these resolutions at least somewhat realistic.

Stay Vigilant About Monetization

2019 was the year the loot box died (or least started writing up its Last Will and Testament) and it was regular players speaking up that forced the change. The big publishers certainly wouldn’t have given them up on their own. That said, do keep an eye out for new monetization schemes, because you know certain publishers are diligently working on their next big money-grubbing innovation.

Don’t Buy a PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X at Launch

I won’t be sticking to this resolution myself, but if you don’t strictly need a next-gen console for your job like I do, wait a while to buy PS5 or Xbox Series X. Consoles are overpriced at launch and it takes a while before you know if a machine is going to be successful. Also, in most cases, the first great, truly next-gen games don’t come out until about a year into a console’s lifespan. Both the PS5 and XSX are probably going to be around for a while, so sit back, consider your options, and make an informed decision.

Do Buy a Switch if You Haven’t Already

But maybe you have some cash earmarked for a new console just burning a hole in your pocket? Well, if you haven’t already, go ahead and grab yourself a Switch. Yes, it’s not the most powerful machine on the market, but 2019 was the year Nintendo’s little system definitively proved it was more than just a gimmick. The Switch boasts a fantastic library featuring top-notch Nintendo exclusives, the best indies of the past five years, and a handful of surprisingly-solid triple-A ports. I’m a pretty platform-agnostic kind of guy, but this past year most of my gaming free time was spent on the Switch. You might be surprised to find the same thing happening to you.

Don’t Be Jerks to People Who Make the Games You Love

We’re all passionate about his hobby, but that passion can turn into anger when a game or series does something you don’t like. I totally get that, but that said, do keep in mind that games are made by real people, most of whom are just trying their best to make something that will entertain players, so don’t lash out at them. Most of the decisions you’re upset about were probably made by committee in fancy boardrooms, so reserve your anger for publishers, not the rank and file. Also, do try to support devs when stories of crunch or workplace toxicity come out. Happy devs make better games, so better workplace conditions benefit everyone.

Play More Games With Friends

I’ve always believed gaming is at its best when you’re playing with someone close to you on the same couch, or, failing that, a real friend over the Internet. Unfortunately, it’s all too easy to fall into the habit of just playing randoms online – to start thinking of the people you’re playing strictly as adversaries instead of friends. A lot of modern games, particularly battle royale stuff, really encourages that. I can guarantee you’ll feel a little better about the hobby, and have to absorb a lot less abuse from trolls, if you make the time to game with friends and family more often.

Try Something New…

As I’ve said, 2020 is a transition year, so why not branch out with something new? Give a genre you’ve never tried a spin, or give one you gave up on long ago another shot. Give that quirky indie a chance. A lot of 2019’s best games were off the regular beaten path, and the same will probably hold true for 2020.

…But Don’t Be Ashamed to Like What You Like

That said, while trying something new is worthwhile, don’t be afraid to wear your quirky gaming tastes on your sleeve. You don’t have to pretend to be into the next Call of Duty or Madden if you’d rather be playing weird Japanese visual novels. Or dense PC strategy games. Or candy-colored rhythm games. Or Pokemon Go. Or whatever! If you genuinely love CoD, that’s fine too. The gaming scene is more varied than ever, so you do you.

So, there you go, a few suggested New Year’s resolutions for 2020. Of course, nobody’s forcing you to take my advice! What gaming resolutions will you be making in the new year?",https://wccftech.com/new-years-gaming-resolutions-2020/,,,"['Editorial', 'Gaming']"

Traders and officials, going by the ground report on onion crop patterns and expected arrivals in the market, predict that the glut will only increase

After reaching highs of over ₹200 per kg, the price of onions is now seeing a steep crash with the new crop harvested over the last two weeks flooding the market. This has resulted in a glut of onions, say traders.

A kilo of onions, even of the best quality, is now trading at the ₹35 — ₹40 levels in the wholesale market, leaving many farmers who hoped to cash in on the shortage unhappy. They are retailing around ₹40 — ₹50.

Traders and officials, going by the ground report on onion crop patterns and expected arrivals in the market, predict that the glut will only increase. “The prices will fall below ₹20 by the month-end and may even fall below ₹10 by February-end,” predicted Ravi Kumar of the Bangalore Onions and Potatoes Traders’ Association.

This has left the farmers worried. At present, onions from Vijayapura and Chitradurga districts and the Nasik region of Maharashtra are flooding the wholesale markets in the State.

“The earlier crop suffered massive damage owing to heavy rains. Expecting high prices, farmers — even those who used to grow maize for a second crop — started growing onions,” Mr. Kumar explained. More onions are expected to come from Punjab and Madhya Pradesh by February, even as supply from within Karnataka is also expected to go up. This will further lead to crash in prices, traders predict.

“Though the price of onions shot up recently, we did not make much profit, as the yield was very low. Onions had turned wet and were decomposing in the fields itself. What we could sell was very low. But given the prices were started growing them again, only to see the prices crashing in a free fall. It will be tough to bear these losses,” said Basavaraj, a farmer from Vijayapura.

However, G. Srinivasan, Director, HOPCOMS, remains optimistic and says that the demand for onions will also increase especially as many households had limited or even stopped purchasing the staple ingredient for a while. “There will be a stabilisation of prices, but may not crash,” he said

Coconut farmers sustain losses

Coconut farmers, too, are bearing the brunt of the price crash. The price of a quintal of copra (dry coconut) that was in the range of ₹17,000-₹18,000, a few months ago, was trading at ₹11,500 on Saturday at Tiptur APMC, the prime coconut market in the State. The prices of coconuts have also seen a dip, from over ₹20 per nut to ₹17 per nut over the last few days. However, they are still being sold in the range of ₹25 and ₹30 in the retail market.

Devraj, a coconut farmer from Tiptur, said the present copra and coconut prices will not fetch them the cultivation cost.

“The input costs – diesel, labour and fertilizers – have gone up. The cost of copra should at least be around ₹15,000 per quintal if farmers have to recover the cultivation cost. Presently, we are reeling under losses,” he added.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/from-highs-of-200-onion-prices-crash-to-the-35-40-range/article30550785.ece,,,"['Commonwealth Games', 'sport', 'Karnataka', 'Hindi cinema', 'All Reports', 'Jammu and Kashmir']"

Ralph Northam took to a podium in Richmond on Thursday afternoon to declare a state of emergency in Virginia.

Speaking at a press conference Thursday afternoon, Northam also advised all Virginians to avoid large gatherings “for the time being.” He said he was canceling all state conferences and large events for the next 30 days and announced new restrictions on travel for state workers.

“Our top priority is to make sure Virginians stay safe and healthy, and that our response to this situation leaves no one behind,” said Governor Northam. “From our health department, to our schools, to our hospitals, to our transit systems, Virginia’s agencies and institutions have been thoroughly planning for every scenario. This emergency declaration will ensure we can continue to prepare for and appropriately respond to Virginians’ needs during this time.”

The governor’s emergency declaration is an administrative tool that allows for additional flexibility in dealing with the outbreak.

Here are some major parts of Northam’s announcement:

Virginia has over 100,000 state employees stationed throughout the Commonwealth. Governor Northam has halted all official travel outside of Virginia by state employees, with increased flexibility for inter-state commuters and essential personnel. Specific guidance will be released to agency heads and state employees, and Virginia will revisit these guidelines after 30 days.

In accordance with advice from state public health experts, the Commonwealth of Virginia will cancel all specially-scheduled state conferences and large events for a minimum of 30 days.

While containing the spread of the public health threat remains a top priority, Governor Northam is working with state and local partners to ensure Virginia are prepared for any continued economic disruption.

Demonstration and march (procession) marked the strike in the state capital. Bankers demonstrated at Oriental Bank of Commerce (OBC), Press Complex, impacting banking services in the region.

They also put up 12-point demands including minimum wage of Rs 21,000 and pension of Rs 10,000 among all departments.

The National Open Mass Convention of Workers organised by the ten Central Trade Unions namely INTUC, AITUC, HMS, CITU, AIUTUC, TUCC, SEWA, AICCTU, LPF, UTUC, independent federations and associations of various sectors including some independent unions called for a nationwide general strike against the anti-worker, anti people, anti-national policies of the Modi-2 Government.

Western central Railways (WCR) Employees Union Philip Oommen said, “We have supported the strike on the basis of demands which are well justified. We hold demonstration to extend moral support to strike which was against central government anti-employees policies.”

INTUC (BHEL) president RD Tripathi said, “All the trade unions were on strike in BHEL in response to the nationwide strike call against central government anti-employees policies. It was big strike against union government.”

The other contestants in the BB 13 final are Sidharth Shukla, Rashami Desai, Arti Singh, Asim Riaz and Paras Chhabra.","Bigg Boss 13's Shehnaaz Gill is one of the most deserving contestants to win the show.

Bigg Boss 13 contestant Shehnaaz Gill was a known face in Punjab before she entered the BB house. But, after she appeared on the show, the singer has become a household name across India. Shehnaaz was one contestant who has been entertaining the viewers even before she entered the BB house.

Shehnaaz introduced herself to Salman Khan as Punjab Ki Katrina Kaif. Initially, Shehnaaz was seen trying to bond with Paras Chhabra but after Paras chose Mahira Sharma over her on more than one occasion, she thought it better to stay away from him. Shehnaaz, who is lovingly called Sana by her housemates, displayed all kinds of emotions in the house. She never shied away from calling a spade a spade.

Shehnaaz Gill stood by Shefali Bagga when the entire house was against her. She wasn't scared of anyone and supported what she felt was right. She was also the only one who was very clear about her priorities on the show. She has always said that all that matters to her in this game is Sidharth Shukla and would mostly get affected by things related to him.

On the show, Shehnaaz Gill has become quite popular and now enjoys a huge fan following. Apart from Sidharth Shukla and Rashami Desai, she was another contestant who was nominated many times on the show but every time, her fans saved her.

Be it her gidda performance with Sidharth Shukla, or her conversation with the crow, every time Shehnaaz Gill has managed to win our hearts with her cute antics. Initially, Bigg Boss 13 wasn't that interesting, but two contestants who made it bearable with their presence were Shehnaaz Gill and Sidharth Shukla. She was a great find by the makers as her presence in the show helped keep its entertainment quotient high.

Every weekend, Shehnaaz's conversation with Salman Khan left the viewers and Salman in splits. Shehnaaz displayed her romantic side with Sidharth and also showed her fierce side while protecting him when he got into a fight with their housemates.

The winner of Bigg Boss needs to be someone who manages to entertain no matter what. Shehnaaz Gill is one contestant who brought a smile on the viewers' face whenever she appeared on screen. She is clearly the entertainment queen of this season and deserves to win the show more than anyone else.

2461,1551432131,,Foundation laying for 2 firms shelved over locals’ opposition,en,,,,,"Jajpur/Kalinganagar: People’s demand for industrialisation in Jajpur district seems to be on the wane as two industrial units failed to lay their foundation stones over the last two weeks due to stiff opposition by locals, a report said.

The opposition of the residents stems from the fact that the firms were trying to take over the public land for establishment of their units and were ignoring employment of locals.

Reports said Kesika Metallics had planned for its ground breaking ceremony near the Biju Patnaik Park at Kalinganagar March 7 while Darcl Logistics had planned its foundation stone laying ceremony Tuesday.

Darcl Logistics had planned to establish its hub over 10 acre of land in Danagadi tehsil but its plan for laying the foundation stone was frustrated after locals opposed handing over the land, comprising a pastureland and playground, to the firm. This led to face-off between the locals and the police personnel present there.

Locals alleged that when the district administration had imposed prohibitory orders under Section 144 of CrPc over coronavirus scare, the Dangadi tehsil officials carrying out measurement of the land and the foundation stone laying ceremony are in clear defiance of the collector’s order.

It is alleged that the firms overlooking the problems of the residents and the displaced has led to a sharp resentment among the locals.

Moreover, the chances of getting employment in these firms were getting slimmer by the day on account of which locals are no longer enthusiastic about industrialisation.

The firms which had earlier established their units here never tried to fulfill the aspirations of the local people on the fronts of employment and peripheral development. And this led to discontent among the people.

The state government has planned to build Kalinganagar as a mega industrial hub for which many downstream industries from in and out of the state have expressed their interests to establish their units here.

The locals were also annoyed on the construction of a logistics park on a forest land adjoining the land identified for Darcl Logistics.

A local environmental outfit, Kalinganagar Parivesh Surakshya Samiti, has filed a case (42.2019) in the National Green Tribunal on construction of the logistics park. The case is sub-judice.

Narayan Dixit, additional tehsildar of Danagadi, said they were measuring the land for handing it over to Darcl Logistics but postponed it due to opposition by locals.",https://www.orissapost.com/foundation-laying-for-2-firms-shelved-over-locals-opposition/,,,"['Opposition', 'foundation stone', 'industrialisation', 'JAJPUR DISTRICT']"

A 99-year-old WWII veteran has beaten COVID-19! He was given a round of applause as he was discharged from the hospital. Albert Chambers is back home after recovering from the deadly virus at Tickhill Road Hospital in Doncaster, northern England. The courageous vet turns 100 in July!

Albert was admitted to the hospital three weeks ago after injuring his wrist in a fall. While he was there, he began to show coronavirus-like symptoms and soon tested positive for the virus. Despite everyone fearing the worst, he miraculously recovered. When he was being discharged, he was seen off with a guard of honor and the incredible moment was captured on video, too!

Albert Chambers miraculously beats COVID-19

“Thank you very much, I appreciate every bit you’ve done for me. It couldn’t have been better,” Albert tells the nurses who took care of him while he was sick. His grandson, 49-year-old Stephen Gater, said that they were preparing for the worst when they learned their grandfather had contracted coronavirus. However, they say that they believe Albert’s “fortitude” was what helped him pull through… the fortitude that he earned during his time as a British Army soldier during World War II.

RELATED: Coronavirus Survivor Turns 104, Survived WWII And 1918 Flu

In the midst of the war, Albert was captured by the enemy after being injured in a bomb blast in North Africa. He was then Fallingbostel in northwestern Germany and was held there as a prisoner of war for three years. After that war, he would continue to protect London’s royal palaces in the Coldstream Guards.

Using his story as a message of hope

“My grandad is amazing. He’s pretty incredible. He’s not only survived the war and being in prison camp, now he’s won the battle with coronavirus,” Albert’s grandson says of his grandfather. Gater also says that the family hopes to use Albert’s story as a hopeful message during these difficult times.

“When we heard the news we feared the worst but he’s pulled through and it’s amazing — the staff there are incredible and we owe them a huge amount of gratitude. We were clapping very ferociously last night at 8 o’clock along with everyone else. It’s testament to the care he was getting and his positive attitude and his fortitude.” We’re so happy to hear that Albert has recovered and is resting at home now!",https://doyouremember.com/116113/99-year-old-albert-chambers-beats-coronavirus,,,"['veteran', 'virus']"

Senior Tory MPs are urging Boris Johnson to relax the two-metre rule to prevent job losses, it has been reported.

Concerns have been raised that parts of the hospitality industry won’t be able to get all staff back to work if the social distancing rule has to be observed.

Greg Clark, chair of the Commons Science Committee, told the Daily Telegraph he had written to Mr Johnson in favour of a new 1.5-metre rule that could save thousands from redundancy.

He said: ‘The difference between two metres and 1.5 metres may seem small but it can be the difference between people being able to go to work and losing their jobs.’

Mr Clark highlighted a paper from the Scientific Advisory Group on Emergencies (Sage) which he claimed indicated a ‘sharp’ fall in infection risk at 1.5 metres and does not appear to establish any need for a two-metre gap.

The paper said social distancing at less than two-metres can be workable in some areas provided workers stick to other virus control measures, he added.

Meanwhile, former Brexit secretary David Davis told the newspaper that the government should relax the two-metre rule as it dilutes the furlough scheme.

He warned many firms would have to remain shut due to the rule while the amount the government contributes to the furlough scheme starts to taper off.

Commons Science Committee chair Greg Clark said his recommendation was backed by research (Picture: AFP/GETTY IMAGES)

He said: ‘What will happen is that they will shut, meaning the furlough money is wasted, and there will be no tax revenue from that business’.

Not all countries recommend social distancing at two metres. In France, for example, the government urges citizens to stay ‘at least one metre’ away from others.

Experts heading up the government’s response to Covid stressed the importance of the current rules on Thursday, although they did highlight grey areas in the science of social distancing.

The Government’s chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said: ‘It’s not an absolute (that) beyond two metres is safe and slightly less is not safe, there’s a graduation across that, and so roughly at a metre it’s somewhere between 10 and 30 times more risky than at two metres.’

England’s chief medical officer Professor Chris Whitty said that staying two metres apart when meeting someone outside would rule them out of being counted as a contact under the track & trace scheme – meaning one would not need to self-isolate if the other developed coronavirus.

Boris Johnson added: ‘I must stress that to control the virus, everyone needs to stay alert, act responsibly, strictly observe social distancing rules, and stay two metres apart from those who you do not live with.’

Read more at straitstimes.com.","KOTA KINABALU - The chief of Parti Islam SeMalaysia (PAS) who enjoys close ties with Umno leaders has said that Islam doesn't have the swearing of an oath as carried out by ex-premier Najib Razak recently, to deny his involvement in the murder of a Mongolian woman.

PAS president Abdul Hadi Awang was quoted on Wednesday (Jan 1) by Free Malaysia Today (FMT) news site as saying there is only the ""li'an"" oath in Islam, which is sworn by a husband and his wife in cases of suspected adultery where legal proof is unavailable.

Datuk Seri Hadi was answering a question by a member of an audience who wanted to know about Najib's oath, at a talk in the Sabah capital on Tuesday (Dec 31), FMT said.

According to Mr Hadi, an influential ustaz (Islamic cleric) in his party, there are no other legal oaths in Islam, though there are no restrictions against anyone wanting to take whatever oath, FMT reported.

""But if the accused does not have any witnesses, it's best to keep quiet,"" he was quoted as saying.

Najib on Dec 20 swore an oath in a mosque in Kuala Lumpur to deny an accusation that he gave the order to kill Mongolian national Altantuya Shaariibuu.

The accusation was made by former police commando Azilah Hadri, who was convicted in 2009 of the murder, in a recent statutory declaration (SD).

Altantuya, 28, was shot and her body blown up with explosives in a gruesome murder in 2006.

Najib carried out the controversial oath inside Masjid Jamek in Kampung Baru after Friday prayers.

Mr Hadi - whose decision to get close to Najib, when the latter was Umno president, paved the way for close Umno-PAS ties today - warned against being too eager to take such oaths as it may incur Allah's displeasure, FMT said.

The solemn oath, called sumpah laknat in Malay, is rarely uttered by Muslims as it calls for divine retribution on the party who is lying.

This was the second time that Najib has sworn using the sumpah laknat in dealing with the murder of Altantuya.

Najib swore a similar oath in 2008 at the height of the controversy over Ms Altantuya's murder, in a mosque in Penang.

When Najib made the second oath on Dec 20, retired military general Mohamed Arshad Raji was quoted as saying Najib should stop ""making a mockery of the Islamic religious oath"".

Mr Arshad, chief of the National Patriot Association said, as quoted by Malaysiakini: ""An allegation of murder is a very serious matter. It is not a trivial matter such as a chicken or a goat has gone missing in a kampung where the matter can be settled with a sumpah (oath)"".",http://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/pas-chief-hadi-says-islam-doesnt-have-oath-as-sworn-by-najib-in-altantuya-case-report,,,"['NAJIB RAZAK', 'ISLAM', 'MURDER/MANSLAUGHTER', 'MALAYSIA']"

COUNCILS across Northern Ireland have spent more than £130,000 of ratepayers' cash in recent years entering themselves into awards competitions.

The spending included entering awards to recognise well-managed public parks, gongs to celebrate publicity and marketing, and the ""Loo of the Year Awards"".

Local authorities in the north have paid a total of £136,091.56 to enter 70 awards contests since 2017, records obtained by The Irish News reveal.

A further £13,082.78 was spent attending ceremonies for those awards in which they paid an entry fee and subsequently received nominations.

Public spending campaigners accused councils of misusing ratepayers' funds in ""forking out for these trivial trophies"".

But councils defended the costs, saying that such gongs are an ""important part of maintaining motivation"" among staff.

The figures were obtained through a series of Freedom of Information (FOI) requests.

Causeway Coast and Glens was the only one of the north's 11 councils to refuse to disclose the information, saying it would exceed FOI legislative cost limits.

Antrim and Newtownabbey council spent the most on entering awards competitions at £34,508.25, followed by Belfast City Council at £31,931.

Belfast spent £3,732 entering the Loo of the Year Awards in 2017 and 2018 and a further £196.39 on travel to attend the ceremony in 2018.

Ards and North Down Borough Council also entered the Loo of the Year Awards in each of the past three years, costing ratepayers £1,592.

Among the awards Antrim and Newtownabbey entered was the CIPR (Chartered Institute of Public Relations) Northern Ireland ""PRide Awards"", which cost £2,120 in the past three years.

In 2019 it won a gold award in the ""Best Use of Social Media"" category and two silvers in the categories ""Best Use of Content"" and ""Best Use of Influencer Relations"" for a recycling campaign.

Much of the spending among the councils went towards entering the Green Flag Awards, in which well-managed public parks and green spaces are awarded the accolade. The scheme is managed in the north by environmental charity Keep Northern Ireland Beautiful.

James Roberts, political director of the TaxPayers' Alliance, criticised the spending on awards competitions.

""Town hall bosses should not be misusing ratepayers' money in a pointless attempt to get some gongs,"" he said.

""While going for grants and private sponsorship can bring cash prizes to the local area, these awards are a waste of time and simply see council officers patting themselves on the back at ratepayers' expense.

""Local residents are the real judges of council performance, so perhaps authorities should focus on winning their approval instead of forking out for these trivial trophies.""

Belfast City Council, the north's largest local authority, defended the spending.

""Our staff are committed to serving the interests and needs of all local residents to the best of their ability, as well as fulfilling the ambitions of the Belfast Agenda,"" a spokesman said.

""As part of this, it is important to show appreciation for the invaluable contribution made by individuals and teams, where staff have demonstrated exceptional levels of service provision and effort, which in many cases, go well beyond the call of duty.

""Reward and recognition is an important part of maintaining motivation and ensuring continued strength in overall performance, city leadership and the delivery of services for our ratepayers.""

In relation to the Green Flag Award, he said this is a ""non-profit international accreditation scheme that recognises and rewards well-managed parks and green spaces"".

Nota actualizada a las 09:20

En el octavo piso de la Corte Nacional de Justicia (CNJ) en Quito se instaló hacia las 09:00 de este miércoles el décimo segundo día de audiencia de juzgamiento en el caso Sobornos 2012-2016, con la presencia de varios abogados en Guayaquil, quienes participan mediante videoconferencia de la diligencia.

Jorge Glas, el exvicepresidente y exministro Coordinador de los Sectores Estratégicos del Gobierno de Rafael Correa, abrirá la jornada de testimonios que ha preparado su defensa para rechazar las acusaciones que le hace Fiscalía de que es el autor directo del delito de cohecho dentro de este caso.

Mediante videoconferencia desde el Centro de Rehabilitación Social de Cotopaxi, en Latacunga, es como participa Glas de la audiencia de juzgamiento que entró en su día 12 de desarrollo. Alexis Mera, exsecretario jurídico de la Presidencia en el régimen de Correa, también participará mediante videoconferencia desde su casa en Guayaquil, donde cumple arresto domiciliario.

La audiencia de juicio por el delito de cohecho se instaló el 10 de febrero pasado y ha tenido una serie de suspensiones debido a recursos presentados por los abogados de los procesados, entre otros hechos.

Una de las últimas suspensiones se dio el lunes pasado, debido al fallecimiento de la madre del presidente del Tribunal de Juzgamiento, Iván León.

La fiscal general Diana Salazar, el procurador Iñigo Salvador y los abogados de la acusación se solidarizan con el juez Leon por el momento de dolor que atraviesa. El juez Marco Rodríguez, quien es parte del Tribunal de Juicio, agradeció las muestras de solidaridad con su compañero de la Corte Nacional de Justicia.

Glas es parte de una lista de alrededor 95 personas, entre testigos y peritos, que ha convocado Harrison Salcedo, abogado del exvicepresidente. Él busca probar la teoría de que su cliente no ha recibido dinero de entidad pública o privada alguna para el beneficio ilícito de un contrato o adjudicación de obra.

Inicialmente el turno de la defensa de Glas para presentar su prueba de descargo era el jueves pasado, pero debido a que ninguno de los llamados asistió el Tribunal suspendió la misma para las 08:30 del lunes último, pero tampoco se dio.

Según Salcedo, Glas será el primero en intervenir y luego irá evacuando peritos y testigos que vayan llegando a la sala de audiencias del octavo piso de la Corte Nacional de Justicia. El abogado ha dicho que espera usar al menos el 80% de peritos y testigos convocados.

Salcedo ha explicado que la mayor parte de testigos y peritos que solicitó son los que la misma Fiscalía prescindió en su momento. “Queremos saber por qué Fiscalía prescindió y para llegar a la verdad de aquello hay que examinar a todos sus testigos. Nosotros queremos examinar a todos los que estuvieron dentro de los procesos investigativos”, indicó. (I)

Twin sisters who had both worked as nurses have died within three days of each other after both testing positive for Covid-19.

Children's nurse Katy Davis, 37, died at Southampton General Hospital on Tuesday while her identical twin, Emma, a former surgery nurse, died early on Friday.

The two sisters, who both suffered from an underlying health condition, have been praised for their excellent work in the nursing profession.

Their sister Zoe Davis told the BBC: ""They always said they had come into the world together and would go out together as well.

""There are no words to describe how special they were.""

(Image: PA)

Zoe said the ""amazing"" pair, who lived together, had other health conditions and had been unwell for some time.

A spokesman for University Hospital Southampton (UHS) said that Katy had worked as risk and patient safety lead in child health but had been unwell for a period prior to her admittance to hospital when she tested positive for Covid-19.

He added that Emma had also worked for UHS for nine years as a nurse in surgery in the colorectal unit until 2013.

The spokesman said: ""She had the same underlying health condition as Katy and had been unwell prior to her admission when she tested positive for Covid-19.

2598,1483996933,,Clippers Beat Kings 105-87,en,,,,Paul George and Kawhi Leonard had far more success passing the ball in the first half than they did shooting it – and the Clippers still put up nearly 60 points.,"SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — Paul George and Kawhi Leonard had far more success passing the ball in the first half than they did shooting it – and the Clippers still put up nearly 60 points.

That, as Leonard pointed out afterward, bodes well for a franchise in serious pursuit of its first NBA championship.

George had 21 points with season highs of 11 rebounds and nine assists to shake off a slow start, and short-handed Los Angeles thumped the Sacramento Kings 105-87 on Tuesday.

Leonard scored 14 of his 24 points in the third quarter to help the Clippers to their 14th consecutive win in Sacramento dating to 2013.

“That’s what championship teams are about,” said Leonard, who led Toronto to the title a year ago before signing with the Clippers in hopes of bringing a banner to Los Angeles.

“Going through playoff runs, the best players aren’t going to play great some nights. It might be somebody off the bench or somebody (else) starting that has a big game that propels us to win.”

Ivica Zubac added eight points and 13 rebounds and Maurice Harkless scored 12 points for the Clippers. Los Angeles also got a big lift from Larry Shamet and Derrick Walton Jr., who combined for 19 points.

That was pivotal on a night when George shot 6 of 25 and Leonard was 8 of 21.

“We just kind of hung in there,” Los Angeles coach Doc Rivers said. “We went zone a little bit and changed our look. I just like our defense.”

The Clippers played without Patrick Beverley and sixth man Lou Williams. Beverley is nursing a sprained right wrist he injured during Saturday night’s loss in Utah, while Williams missed the game because of personal reasons.

Richaun Holmes had 22 points and 10 rebounds for Sacramento. The Kings have lost eight straight.

“They pushed us around out there and they had their way,” Sacramento coach Luke Walton said. “We have to come together and we’ve got to be mentally stronger, physically stronger and fight our way out of it. That’s the only way to get out of this type of slump that we’re in, and we’ve done it before.”

Three days after a 13-point loss to Utah, Los Angeles took control in the first half despite both George and Leonard struggling offensively. The All-Stars missed 17 of their first 24 shots combined.

Both got going after the break.

Leonard made five of seven shots in the third quarter, and George – who missed eight of his first nine shots beyond the arc – made a 3 to open the fourth. George added another 3-pointer later that put the Clippers ahead 103-86.

“I had the mindset of just go and attack, be aggressive, be physical,” George said. “I got the spots I wanted to. I got to the shots I wanted to. But it’s just that stretch for me right now where the ball’s not going down.”

Even with Leonard and George struggling most of the first half, the Clippers still built a big lead on the slumping Kings late in the second quarter. Shamet’s 3-pointer gave Los Angeles a 57-40 halftime lead.

Leonard got going in the third and the Clippers went on a 9-2 run to extend their lead to 19. Montrezl Harrell tipped in an offensive rebound then made a pair of free throws that made it 85-66.

WIN, THEN LOSE, THEN WIN

The Clippers have alternated wins and losses over the past nine games. George said that’s indicative of a team with new players still trying to adjust. “We’ve probably got one game under our belt where everybody’s been healthy,” George said. “We’re still learning each other. Our winning streak’s going to come, sooner than later I believe.”

TIP-INS

Clippers: Beverley was injured Saturday against Utah. Although X-rays taken on his wrist were negative, Beverley is expected to miss a handful of games.

Kings: De’Aaron Fox had nine points and six assists after sitting out most of two games because of back spasms. … Sacramento’s losing streak is its longest since an eight-game stretch two seasons ago.

2620,1530625133,,Decision on Mashrafe’s ODI career in next BCB meeting,en,,,,,"DHAKA, Feb 25, 2020 (BSS)- The decision on whether Mashrafe would be allowed to continue his cricketing career after the three-match ODI series against Zimbabwe will be taken in the next meeting of the Bangladesh Cricket

Board (BCB), said its president Nazmul Hassan Papon.

The BCB head had already made it clear that they would choose a captain,

considering the 2023 World Cup as they want the team to get ample time under

new captain to build them for the cricket’s biggest extravaganza.

This put a question mark on Mashrafe’s career as the BCB president cast a

doubt on the lanky fast bowler’s ability to pass the modern beep test which

determines the players’ fitness.

But he said that Mashrafe, whose retirement issue came to the fore once as

he performed badly in the 2019 World Cup, would play the series against

Zimbabwe as captain.

This will be Mashrafe first series since the World Cup in which took just

one wicket in eight matches. Mashrafe missed the three-match ODI series in

Sri Lanka after the World Cup due to hamstring injury.

“I didn’t say anything like that Mashrafe won’t be the part of the team

after the Zimbabwe series. I said that we will take a decision about the

captain in the next board meeting,” Papon said.

“I can’t say before the meeting that whether he [Mashrafe] would play or

not, or whether he would be captain or not. Till this series against

Zimbabwe, he is okay and he will be the captain.”

Mashrafe is currently playing just ODI format of the cricket and since he

shows his reluctance to walk into sunset in the near future, question came to

the fore whether he will play the one-off ODI against Pakistan in Karachi.

Papon remained tightlipped on this issue, saying, “Before the ODI against

Pakistan, a board meeting will be held. As I said earlier, everything will be

decided in that meeting.”",http://www.bssnews.net/?p=353616,,,
2626,1540453433,,Inmigración: A qué inmigrantes de Cuba afecta la carga pública,en,,,,"Emigrantes cubanos impactados por regla de carga pública de EEUU incluye a quien llega por reclamación familiar o con visa. Si son residentes y recibieron ayuda, afecta petición de ciudadanía americana.","Los inmigrantes cubanos, que por décadas gozaron de privilegios en las leyes de inmigración en Estados Unidos, reciben ahora un tratamiento igualitario a otros inmigrantes en algunas de la nuevas políticas migratorias de la administración de Donald Trump.

En particular, la regla de Inmigración sobre la carga pública como causal de inadmisibilidad sí impacta a grupos de personas oriundas de Cuba, si bien otras, aquellas amparadas por la Ley de Ajuste Cubano (CAA), están exentas de esta normativa que ha generado gran confusión en la comunidad.

A fin de aclarar dudas al respecto, AccesoUSA entrevistó al doctor Ángel Leal, abogado de inmigración con bufete en Miami y amplia experiencia en la migración cubana.

Qué cambia la regla de carga pública

Las noticias locales nunca han sido más importantes Suscríbase para obtener acceso digital ilimitado a las noticias importantes de su comunidad #TuNoticiaLocal

Hay cuatro cambios sustanciales:

▪ La nueva definición amplía quién puede ser considerado carga pública. Antes era primordialmente una persona dependiente de la asistencia pública. A partir de ahora, es una persona que tenga probabilidad de acceder a ciertos programas de ayuda gubernamental por un periodo de 12 meses durante el transcurso de tres años.

▪ Han ampliado el número de programas asistenciales que son indicadores de carga pública, de cuatro a nueve. Los nuevos son tres programas de vivienda pública, incluyendo el Plan 8, versiones de Medicaid que incluyan financiamiento federal y los sellos alimenticios o food stamps.

▪ Ahora se toman en cuenta factores relacionados con el extranjero, como edad y empleo, cuando anteriormente la declaración jurada de Patrocinio económico era suficiente para demostrar que alguien no tenía probabilidad de convertirse en carga pública.

▪ Invoca una cláusula poco utilizada, la posibilidad de pedir una Fianza por Concepto de Carga Pública al extranjero que Inmigración considere puede depender en cualquier momento del gobierno, por un monto mínimo de $8,100.

Qué inmigrantes cubanos sí se ven afectados y quiénes no

Los cubanos que obtengan la residencia a través de la Ley de Ajuste Cubano al año y un día de entrar a EEUU no se ven afectados.

El cubano que sí se perjudica es aquel que viene por reunificación familiar, porque esta implica una Declaración Jurada de Patrocinio Económico, conocida como el affidavit, un contrato legal en el que el peticionario del inmigrante se compromete a respaldar financieramente a su familiar. Esto abarca no usar ciertos beneficios públicos.

En otras palabras, cualquier cubano que esté esperando una reclamación familiar y tenga que ir a una entrevista consular se verá impactado.

Cubanos que entran con visa de turista o ESTA

Muchos cubanos ingresan con la visa de visitante temporal (B-1 para negocios y B-2 para turismo), y algunos otros, de tener pasaporte español, con el Sistema Electrónico para la Autorización de Viajes (ESTA o exención de visa); esperan un año y un día, y piden la green card por Ajuste Cubano.

Si bien al acogerse a la Ley de Ajuste técnicamente no tienen que presentar un affidavit porque no hay patrocinador, las autoridades igual pudieran investigar si en el momento de obtener la visa se les debió negar por concepto de carga pública.

Por eso es importante que la conducta, especialmente al principio, sea consistente con el propósito turístico y evitar cualquier asistencia gubernamental, porque pudiera considerarse fraude migratorio, ya que obtuvo visa demostrando que no iba a ser carga pública y terminó recibiendo ayudas.

Lee más: La ciudadanía, el anhelo de los inmigrantes no es tan difícil de alcanzar. Aquí te decimos cómo

Migrantes cubanos que vienen a EEUU con ‘parole’

El parole es un tipo especial de ingreso al país que permite la admisión temporal en Estados Unidos. Generalmente a los cubanos con parole, el gobierno les concede una autorización de empleo provisional mientras esperan para lograr ajustar su estatus.

Pero, desde que el gobierno de Barack Obama puso fin a la antigua política de “pies secos, pies mojados” en 2017, realmente ya son pocos los cubanos que obtienen parole.

Sin embargo, un extranjero que recibe parole tiene acceso a ayudas gubernamentales y, por lo tanto, en su caso generalmente no se toma en cuenta la regla de carga pública.

Solicitantes de la ciudadanía americana inadmisibles

Aunque la norma no afecta a los solicitantes de la ciudadanía americana, los funcionarios de USCIS tienen potestad de revisar si cuando alguien se hizo residente ya era inadmisible bajo el concepto de carga pública.

Indiscutiblemente que muchos cubanos que ya son residentes sí deben preocuparse, al solicitar la ciudadanía, si recibieron asistencia pública y estaban sujetos al causal de inadmisibilidad de carga pública.

De todo lo relacionado con carga pública, ese aspecto de que en el proceso de la ciudadanía los oficiales de inmigración van a investigar el inicio del proceso de residencia para determinar que la persona haya sido admisible y no una posible carga pública, es uno de los más peligrosos.

Toma nota: Si pide visa para EEUU vele sus redes sociales, el ojo del gobierno lo va a tener bien cerca

Si alguien consiguió la residencia al ingresar mediante el Programa de Reunificación Familiar y se presentó una declaración jurada de patrocinio económico, técnicamente esa persona no debía acceder a asistencia gubernamental porque hay un patrocinio económico por parte del peticionario.

Ese es el caso que debemos investigar, primero para ver si entró bajo affidavit o no en aquel momento, segundo para ver si se pidió asistencia pública, y tercero para verificar si esa asistencia pública es la que se considera hoy día carga pública.

Lo que se recomienda es se haga una solicitud de expedientes a través de la Ley de Libertad de Información (FOIA) para que veamos el historial y recopilemos la información personal y entonces podamos recomendar si presentar o no la petición de ciudadanía. Lo que menos queremos es poner en riesgo la residencia con una ciudadanía indebidamente presentada.

El cubano que pide asilo, ¿puede acogerse a la Ley de Ajuste?

Generalmente no. El que se presenta en la frontera sur está bajo protocolos de protección migratoria desde el lado mexicano; le dejan entrar temporalmente por un día para asistir a corte, pero no durante un año y un día.

Los que están detenidos en su gran mayoría no salen bajo parole, como cuando estaba vigente la política de “pies secos, pies mojados”, sino bajo fianza o en libertad condicional con órdenes de supervisión.

Por otra parte, para los que sí califican porque tienen parole y un año y un día presente, y tienen un proceso de corte de inmigración pendiente, no dejen de asistir a corte porque califican a la Ley de Ajuste; hay que lidiar con ambos temas. No ignoren el proceso judicial.

Toma nota: Cómo afectan a inmigrantes en 2020 los cambios en política de inmigración

Cómo demostrar a Inmigración la nacionalidad cubana

Es un tema legal que ha cambiado mucho, particularmente entre los hijos de cubanos que nacen en el exterior y quieren acogerse a la Ley de Ajuste Cubano.

Ya a finales del año pasado, Inmigración emitió un memorando que establece el criterio sobre si un solicitante es cubano o no. En pocas palabras, le va a exigir que muestre un pasaporte cubano o un certificado de ciudadanía o nacionalidad.

La persona que nace en el exterior, hijo de cubanos que antes iba a un consulado cubano y le daban certificado de nacimiento en el exterior de padres cubanos, eso ya no es prueba suficiente de su ciudadanía cubana; Inmigración no lo acepta y el caso de ajuste no procede.

Las autoridades migratorias quieren un certificado de ciudadanía, de nacionalidad registrado en La Habana, Cuba, o pasaporte cubano. Antes de presentar un ajuste cubano, si se trata de un hijo de cubano nacido en el exterior, debe verificar si tiene acceso a uno de estos documentos.

She remembered Gianna as intelligent, silly, and athletically skilled, calling the 13-year-old a “sweet and gentle soul.”

“Gigi was very competitive like her daddy, but Gianna had a sweet grace about her. Her smile was like sunshine. Her smile took up her entire face like mine — Kobe always said she was me. She had my fire. My personality and sarcasm. She was tender and loving on the inside. She had the best laugh. It was infectious. It was pure and genuine,” Vanessa said of their daughter.

She remembered Kobe as a doting father who put his family first. She described him as a romantic and said she dreamed of growing old with him.

“God knew they couldn’t be on this earth without each other. He had to bring them home to heaven together,” Vanessa said, adding “Babe, you take care of our Gigi.” May Kobe and Gianna rest in peace. Our prayers are with Vanessa and the girls at this time.",https://web.archive.org/web/20210412055201id_/https://cassiuslife.com/110183/vanessa-bryant-speech-kobe-gianna-memorial/,,,"['kobe bryant', 'Newsletter', '#BlackLivesMatter', 'Gianna Bryant', '#Casbar', '#Spirit.Ed', '#CASSIUSGems', '#GrownManSh*t', '#NBA', '#GeekOut', 'Kobe Bryant', '#Coronavirus', 'Vanessa', 'Beyoncé']"

It was the late Senator Dominador Aytona, who before being elected to the Senate, was the chief budget officer of the Republic, and briefly Central Bank governor, who defined the General Appropriations Act or the national budget as “the economic program of the country in pesos and centavos.” As such, it can be argued that passing the budget is the most important piece of legislation for Congress to enact each year. It was during the martial law period that the Budget Commission was re-engineered into the Ministry of Budget and Management through the Budget Reform Decree issued by President Ferdinand Marcos, which strengthened the planning, programming and budgeting linkages of the office, with monitoring offices in every administrative region of the country. At the time, the legislature, Batasang Pambansa, was a mere rubber stamp of the Executive, further neutered by Amendment No. 6 of a Constitution “ratified” by the people under authoritarian rule. But with the re-birth of a system of checks and balances as provided for in the 1987 Constitution, congressional power of the budgetary system returned, and the House Committee on Appropriations, with its counterpart Finance Committee in the Senate, became the most highly-prized committees in Congress. Essentially, the budget process begins each year with the Development Budget Coordination Committee issuing guidelines to the different agencies of government as early as the last quarter of the preceding year. For the first three to four months of the year, agencies submit their proposed expenditure programs, which are then synthesized into what is called the National Expenditure Program. The proposed program of expenditures along with sources of financing, then goes to the President for final approval before presentation to the legislature. Submitted right after the President’s State of the Nation Address, Congress then reviews and goes through the process of enacting the General Appropriations Act based on what is referred to as “The President’s Budget.” It has the power to reduce and re-align the items in the President’s Budget. From the House, the appropriations bill goes to the Senate, even if simultaneous hearings on the expenditure program are held by both chambers to be able to enact the law within the year. Conflicting versions are reconciled in a bicameral conference committee where both houses meet to hammer out a final version, which is then passed by their respective chambers to become the General Appropriations Act for the succeeding year. The bicameral conference committee is thus labelled the “third house” of Congress. It is becoming increasingly clear, or in the parlance of the lawyers, abundantly clear, that the brouhaha in the lower House last week, which resulted in the surgical removal of the appropriations committee chairman, Isidro Ungab, replaced by a neophyte party list congressman, was all about control of the budget for the next fiscal year—2021. From the very beginning of his ascent to the speakership, Alan Peter Cayetano named 24 deputy speakers, many of them ceremonial, but for some who exercise “oversight” powers super-imposed over regular committee chairs. One such deputy speaker is the gentleman from Camarines Sur, who was also its former governor, and whose son is the current provincial chief executive—LRay Villafuerte, who I refer to as El Rey.El Rey is one of the more innovative local government officials under whose nine-year reign Camarines Sur displayed tremendous progress. He represents a new breed of dynamic local executives whose governance practices are anchored on vision rather than mere re-election. Because they produce results, the Villafuertes have been re-elected continuously from grandpa Luis to El Rey to Migz, the current governor who is El Rey’s son. But he can also be quite acerbic in language, “palaban” in the native patois, which he has been amply displaying in interviews now that he is a congressman. That made for interesting “sabong” coverage of the events of the last week in the HoR. Because of the importance of the appropriations committee, its chairmen are normally given presidential nihil obstat before the Speaker gets his House to approve of their designation. That the first committee chair in the present Congress is a veteran legislator from Davao City was thus presumably with palace blessings, or at the least, without objection. Little is known about the new appropriations committee chairman, who, while a businessman from the same southern city, is a newbie in legislation if not in government service altogether. But the fact that he was chosen clearly means that he should be able to work well with the Speaker and his alter ego on budgetary matters, El Rey. The other perspective one needs to scrutinize when the Magellan formula takes shape is the date of reckoning. The Lord Allan camp simply says it is October this year, a scant seven months from now. The Alan Peter camp strictly defines the timeline as beginning from July 22, 2019, the day Congress elected him. Fifteen months should therefore mean October 21, 2020, which is under normal timetable just a week before Congress adjourns for the Dia de Los Muertos holidays, and by which time, the House shall have passed its version of the GAA. Which means the Alan Peter camp shall have control of the most important piece of legislation prior to the presidential and national elections of 2022. If it had been an even split of the 36 months of the 18th Congress, then clearly Speaker Alan would helm the House until the end of 2021. But one could surmise that the Lord Allan faction wanted to have a major say in the 2021 GAA, and thus haggled for a Magellan formula, the now famous 15-21 split. The 2021 budget is the election budget. It will be the last time the members of both houses can partake of the bag of goodies so important for them to tout district achievements by way of “projects.” It also is the big scooper of election campaign funding for those so inclined, the kind Ping Lacson has been excoriating against for years and years on end. The 2022 budget is virtually useless for the re-election purpose of legislators, or for their passing the baton to their family herederos. By the time the appropriations are up for taking courtesy of the DBM’s notice of cash allotment, the ban on “project” spending begins. Hence, the 2021 budget is to fight for, and to die for.",https://manilastandard.net/opinion/columns/so-i-see-by-lito-banayo/319164/the-2021-budget.html,,,

To receive a coronavirus economic stimulus payment, Americans need to have filed a tax return for 2018 or 2019, according to new guidance released by the IRS and U.S. Treasury. (iStock / Getty Images Plus)

RHODE ISLAND — In the next three weeks, most Americans are expected to start receiving payments that are part of a nearly $2 trillion economic stimulus package approved by Congress and signed into law by President Donald Trump last week. The package is intended to mitigate the economic effects of the new coronavirus outbreak on Americans, small businesses and corporations.

But with so much money in the pipeline, questions remain: What is the government using to determine eligibility? Do we need to apply to receive a payment? Where will the payment go once it's sent? The Internal Revenue Service and U.S. Treasury released guidance this week on the economic stimulus package that explains what Americans should expect and what they need to do to receive their payments. Most won't need to do anything. But just in case, here's a checklist of questions you may not have thought of and others you may already be asking:

Do I need to file a tax return to receive a stimulus payment?

Yes, and while most of us won't need to worry about this requirement, some groups of Americans — including low-income taxpayers, senior citizens, some veterans and individuals with disabilities — typically don't file tax returns.

Originally, Social Security recipients were among those required to file a return to receive the stimulus payment; however, in response to backlash from both sides of the political aisle, the U.S. Treasury announced Wednesday that Social Security recipients are now exempt from the tax return requirement, according to The Washington Post. Finally, anyone who was required to file taxes for 2018 and 2019 and hasn't done so yet should do so right away.

Am I eligible for the economic stimulus payment? Eligible taxpayers who filed tax returns for either 2019 or 2018 will automatically receive an economic impact payment of up to $1,200 for individuals or $2,400 for married couples. Parents also receive $500 for each qualifying child.",https://patch.com/rhode-island/cranston/coronavirus-economic-stimulus-payments-what-you-need-do-ri,,,

Trotz leichter Verluste war am Markt von einer Beruhigung der Lage die Rede. Zuletzt kostete ein Barrel (159 Liter) der Nordseesorte Brent 21,49 US-Dollar. Das waren 14 Cent weniger als am Vortag. Die US-Sorte WTI wurde am Freitag je Barrel zu 17,09 Dollar gehandelt. Sie kostete damit 42 Cent mehr als am Donnerstag.

Zu Wochenbeginn hatte sich am Ölmarkt einmaliges zugetragen. Erstmals war der Preis für einen Terminkontrakt auf Erdöl in den negativen Bereich gefallen. Das Ereignis ist Folge eines beispiellosen Nachfrageeinbruchs wegen der Corona-Krise und eines viel zu hohen Rohölangebots bei fehlender Lagerkapazität.

An dieser Lage hat sich bis zuletzt nichts geändert. Dass die Ölpreise seit Wochenmitte wieder etwas gestiegen sind, ist auf politische Spannungen zwischen den USA und dem Iran zurückzuführen. Hintergrund ist ein Zwischenfall auf offener See, der US-Präsident Donald Trump zu militärischen Drohungen veranlasste. Iran reagierte ähnlich.

""Die kritische Situation am Ölmarkt ist nicht ausgestanden"", kommentierte Rohstofffachmann Eugen Weinberg von der Commerzbank. Es bestünden zahlreiche Risiken auf der Nachfrageseite sowie bei den verfügbaren Lagerkapazitäten.

2736,1607918334,,People smuggling ring uncovered at Helsinki Airport,en,,,,Police suspect an international criminal gang has been trafficking people from mainland Europe to Britain via Finland.,"Police suspect an international criminal gang has been trafficking people from mainland Europe to Britain via Finland.

A gang suspected of smuggling people from mainland Europe to Britain was uncovered in January when a Swedish citizen and a Kuwaiti citizen were stopped by border guards at Helsinki-Vantaa Airport in possession of another Swedish citizen’s passport.

The two men were on their way from Paris to London via Helsinki, according to a statement issued by the Finnish Border Guard.

The Guard’s Crime Prevention Unit launched a preliminary investigation, and discovered that the Swedish man had visited Finland on at least two previous occasions. He is now suspected of smuggling two other people from Finland to Britain between December and January using other people's passports.

Police suspect the involvement of a people smuggling ring active in at least Sweden and the United Kingdom.

They believe the smugglers charge up to 8,000 euros per person transported from mainland Europe through various countries to the United Kingdom.

The initial investigation also revealed that the Swedish citizen stopped in Finland had applied for asylum in the United Kingdom as a Kuwaiti, providing false personal information to the UK authorities.

The false identity used by the suspect in Britain was revealed when his fingerprints were compared to the fingerprints of another Kuwaiti person, and they were found to be exactly the same. Authorities suspect the man created a false identity for himself in order to gain access to a disguise for people smuggling activities.

International cooperation

During the investigation, close international cooperation was established between Finnish authorities and police forces in other parts of Europe, with the support of Europol and Eurojust, an EU agency which oversees judicial cooperation between member states.

Authorities in both Sweden and Britain conducted home searches of suspected members of the smuggling ring and made a number of arrests.",https://yle.fi/uutiset/osasto/news/people_smuggling_ring_uncovered_at_helsinki_airport/11352556,,,

La demolición de Pyongyang de la oficina de enlace intercoreana ha vuelto a confirmar que Kim Yo Jong, la hermana menor del líder norcoreano Kim Jong Un es una de las personas más poderosas del hermético régimen y potencial heredera del poder supremo.

En marzo pasado emitió el primer comunicado oficial a su nombre. Pero su influencia no ha parado de crecer y desde hace semanas está en el centro de la estrategia norcoreana de ruptura con Seúl.

Mundo ¿Por qué importa tanto al mundo la salud de Kim Jong Un?

El pasado fin de semana anunció que había que ""destruir completamente"" la ""inútil oficina de enlace"" y el martes, las autoridades norcoreanas hicieron añicos esta institución que era uno de los símbolos de la distensión entre las dos Coreas.

Kim Yo Jong es una de las asesoras más cercanas de Kim Jong Un, lo que la convierte en una de las mujeres más poderosas del régimen.

Tras destruir la oficina de enlace intercoreana, Kim Yo Jong rechazó ayer dialogar con el Sur y anunció el reenvío de tropas a la frontera, subrayando su voluntad de reactivar las tensiones y forzar una negociación sobre relajación de sanciones.

En un comunicado difundido por la agencia estatal KCNA, la hermana del líder rechazó el envío de delegados sureños al Norte -una oferta que Seúl aún no había hecho pública- para dialogar y tratar de desactivar la tensión. Kim Yo-jong ""hizo saber nuestra postura de que rechazamos la propuesta siniestra y carente de tacto"".

KCNA publicó un comentario en el que Kim Yo-jong calificó de ""repugnante"" un discurso pronunciado por el presidente surcoreano, Moon Jae-in, con motivo del 20 aniversario de la primera cumbre intercoreana en el que instó al Norte a no dar marcha atrás en el acercamiento.

Kim aseguró que las palabras de Moon estaban cargadas de excusas y que no se disculpó por el envío de panfletos de propaganda contraria al régimen por activistas desde el Sur, motivo por el cual Pionyang asegura que ha optado por cortar lazos con Seúl.

La espectacular demolición de la oficina, aunada a estas nuevas medidas, forman parte de una estrategia de provocaciones que desea lograr concesiones económicas de Seúl y Washington, consideran expertos. Las relaciones intercoreanas se deterioraron profundamente desde el fracaso de la segunda cumbre entre el régimen y Estados Unidos.

The revelation challenges the defense offered by Trump and his attorneys in his Senate impeachment trial and raises the stakes as the chamber decided this week whether to seek sworn testimony from Bolton and other witnesses. Bolton, who acrimoniously left the White House a day before Trump ultimately released the Ukraine aid on Sept. 11, has already told lawmakers that he is willing to testify, despite the president’s order barring aides from cooperating in the investigation.

Democrats need at least four Republicans to vote with them to seek witness testimony. Those prospects looked unlikely in recent days and it’s unclear if the new revelations about Bolton’s book will sway any GOP senators.

Democrats quickly sought to ramp up the pressure on their Republican counterparts.

“John Bolton has the evidence,” tweeted Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. “It’s up to four Senate Republicans to ensure that John Bolton, Mick Mulvaney, and the others with direct knowledge of President Trump’s actions testify in the Senate trial.”

The Associated Press has not confirmed the content of Bolton’s book. A person familiar with the matter told the AP the draft had been submitted to the White House for pre-publication review, which is standard for the work of former officials with security clearances. The person insisted on anonymity to discuss the sensitive subject.

Democrats accuse Trump of abusing his power in withholding the military assistance to Ukraine to push that country to mount investigations into Democrats, including former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter, who served on the board of a Ukraine gas company, Burisma, while his father was in office.

On Saturday, the president’s attorneys said during their opening day of defense arguments that there was no evidence that Trump made the military aid contingent on the country announcing an investigation into Biden.

Trump on Wednesday told reporters in Davos, Switzerland, that he didn’t want Bolton to testify before the Senate.

“The problem with John is it’s a national security problem,” Trump said. “He knows some of my thoughts. He knows what I think about leaders. What happens if he reveals what I think about a certain leader and it’s not very positive and then I have to deal on behalf of the country?”

He added: “It’s going to be very hard. It’s going to make the job very hard.”",https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2020-01-26/report-bolton-says-trump-tied-ukraine-funds-to-biden-probe,,,"['Subscribers Are Reading', 'For Subscribers']"

It was not immediately clear when the suspension would go into effect or how long it would last but the order would likely trigger political and legal pushback. The White House is yet to comment on the development.

The order would mark an extraordinary use of executive power by Trump, who has imposed travel restrictions on a group of nations and regions -- measures that have led to chaos abroad and at US airports.

During his presidency, Trump has maintained a hardline stance on immigration and border security and pushed for a series of controversial measures, including erecting a border wall along the nation's southern border with Mexico in a bid to deter illegal immigrants.

The US has already agreed with both Canada and Mexico to extend border restrictions on non-essential travel until at least mid-May, said the BBC in a report. In recent weeks, emergency powers have been used to expel thousands of undocumented migrants on the US border with Mexico.

The public health measure lets officials override immigration laws, expediting removal processes. His announcement comes at the US has reported 786,968 coronavirus cases, with 42,308 deaths, both figures the highest in the world.

Why Boris Johnson was allowed at the birth of his baby with fiancee Carrie Symonds

The Prime Minister is said to have been able to be at his fiancee's side as she gave birth to their first child together despite the lockdown.

Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, many hospitals are only allowing one birth partner for the duration of labour and delivery, while homebirth services have temporarily been suspended.

Boris Johnson was able to be present at the birth just days after he was cleared to leave hospital after falling ill with Covid-19 himself - because the NHS hospital where his fiancee gave birth does allow dads to attend.

At some hospitals, fathers have been told not to attend pregnancy scans or maternity units, as hospitals bring in restrictions to halt the spread of coronavirus

Hospitals are allowed to bring in their own rules, meaning some have been more strict than others about visitors in birthing rooms during lockdown.

Some maternity units have brought in tight restrictions, as pregnant women are listed among the most vulnerable groups urged to take special precautions during the pandemic.

The couple's son has been named Wilfred Lawrence Nicholas Johnson, with his middle name a tribute to the St Thomas' Hospital doctors the PM credits with saving his life.

Wilfred was born elsewhere, at University College London Hospital (UCLH), where one person is allowed in to accompany women as they give birth during lockdown.

The hospital's advice to expectant mothers says they will have to give birth in an isolation room if they have tested positive for Covid-19.

Some staff would wear personal protective equipment (PPE) if expectant mother has the virus, UCLH's advice says.

The 55-year-old leader's fiancee Carrie Symonds, 32, had already had to self-isolate with symptoms of the virus before she gave birth.

While scientists are still working to understand Covid-19, many experts say it appears patients cannot be infected more than once.

Researchers are working on antibody tests that will be able to tell who has already had coronavirus in hopes working out who may already be immune can help Britain ease out of lockdown.

As Mr Johnson returned to the Downing Street helm last week, his partner and her baby were declared healthy and well after the birth.

A delighted Ms Symonds posted a picture of herself on Instagram last week cradling her first child, saying she “couldn’t be happier” and that her “heart is full”.

El analista político Hiram Guadalupe dijo este lunes a Efe que, en su opinión, más que los nueve candidatos, el dato más relevante lo constituye que el Partido Popular Democrático (PPD), fundado en 1938 por Luis Muñoz Marín, tenga que celebrar primarias por vez primera para escoger a su candidato.

“Las primarias del PPD son el elemento de mayor novedad”, destacó Guadalupe, para quien es notable el que para los comicios de noviembre no haya un candidato de consenso, lo que catalogó de inédito en esta formación ideológicamente de centro que aboga por mantener el actual estatus de la isla como Estado Libre Asociado a Estados Unidos.

HACE 15 AÑOS SE ROMPIÓ EL ESCENARIO CON 3 PARTIDOS

El analistas recordó que desde ya hace 15 años se ha roto la uniformidad de anteriores elecciones en las que a las citas electorales solamente concurrían el PPD, el Partido Nuevo Progresista (PNP), que aboga por la plena anexión a Estados Unidos, y el Partido Independentista Puertorriqueño (PIP).

“Desde hace unos 15 años se ha mostrado una tendencia a democratizar las tendencias políticas”, destacó Guadalupe, tras matizar que el número de nueve candidatos se reducirá obviamente cuando se celebren las primarias del PNP y el PPD el próximo verano.

La profesora de Ciencias Sociales y analista Martha Quiñones señaló a Efe que es de destacar que a estas elecciones concurra un número elevado de candidatos, aunque los que tienen posibilidades reales son muy pocos, salvo sorpresas de última hora.

Quiñones sostuvo que parten con ventaja los dos grandes partidos, ya que el resto no cuenta con el mismo apoyo mediático e incluso tienden a estar “opacados”, dijo, por los medios.

Señaló que en el caso de candidaturas como la de Alexandra Lugaro o Eliezer Molina se trataría de evitar su exposición mediática para que no resten votos del electorado joven a los dos grandes partidos.

La lista de los nueve aspirantes incluye por el opositor PPD a Carmen Yulín Cruz, Eduardo Bhatia y Carlos Delgado, de los que saldrán en primarias el elegido.

PRIMARIAS EN EL PNP ENTRE LA GOBERNADORA Y PIERLUISI

Por el gobernante PNP se jugarán en primarias la candidatura la actual a gobernadora, Wanda Vázquez, y Pedro Pierluisi.

El independentista Juan Dalmau, Alexandra Lúgaro, César Vázquez y Eliezer Molina completan la lista.

La cita del 3 noviembre servirá para que surja el sustituto de Ricardo Rosselló, quien a principios del pasado mes de agosto abandonó de forma efectiva el cargo de gobernador, lo que también supuso un hito en la historia de Puerto Rico al ser la primera vez que el jefe del Ejecutivo abandonaba su puesto en pleno mandato, a 16 meses -entonces- de que se celebren elecciones generales.

Tras anunciar el 24 de julio que dejaría su cargo abandonó el Gobierno para ser sustituido por Pedro Pierluisi.

Este reemplazó a Rosselló luego de que dimitiera por presiones de los puertorriqueños tras la publicación de un “chat” en el que junto a su círculo más íntimo del Gobierno se burlaran de personas de distintos sectores sociales.

Tras unos pocos días de Pierluisi en el cargo, la entonces secretaria de Justicia, Wanda Vázquez, se convirtió en la nueva gobernadora, de acuerdo a la Constitución de la isla.

PAÍS AFECTADO POR LOS TERREMOTOS Y EL COVID-19

El nuevo jefe de Gobierno deberá hacerse cargo a partir del próximo enero de un país que se recupera todavía de los terremotos del pasado invierno y afectado por la pandemia del coronavirus, que hasta hoy ha provocado 142 fallecidos y más de 5.000 contagiados.

La lista de candidatos comienza con la actual gobernadora, Wanda Vázquez, quien parte con la ventaja de ostentar el cargo y de contar con la mayor exposición mediática, aunque las complicadas situaciones que ha tenido que vivir con los terremotos de enero y el COVID-19 puede pasarle factura.

Pedro Pierluisi será un difícil contrincante para Vázquez en las primarias para convertirse en el líder del PNP en los comicios debido a su dilata experiencia en distintos gobiernos.

Dentro de los candidatos del PPD destaca Carmen Yulín Cruz, la actual alcaldesa de San Juan y una de las figuras más mediáticas de la isla por sus enfrentamientos en las redes sociales con el presidente Donald Trump.

El experimentado Eduardo Bhatia será, sin duda, un duro oponente para Cruz, tanto por su prestigio como por su experiencia como presidente del Senado.

Dentro del PPD entra en liza y se medirá a los dos anteriores en primarias Carlos Delgado, alcalde de Isabela.

Juan Dalmau es la apuesta del Partido Independentista Puertorriqueño (PIP), una formación con falta de respaldo como para convertir a este abogado en el nuevo gobernador.

La también abogada Alexandra Lúgaro, que obtuvo un 11,1 % de los votos en las elecciones generales de Puerto Rico de 2016 como independiente, se presenta ahora bajo la insignia del Movimiento Victoria Ciudadana.

El octavo candidato es el médico conservador César Vázquez, que concurre a la gobernación por el Proyecto Dignidad, mientras que el joven y desconocido Eliezer Molina lo hace como único independiente.",https://web.archive.org/web/20211015154648id_/https://holanews.com/nueve-candidatos-aspiran-por-primera-vez-en-puerto-rico-a-gobernar-la-isla/,,,

Today Guardians Of The Galaxy is hailed as one of the best movies that the Marvel Cinematic Universe has spawned, but before its 2014 release, it was considered one of Marvel’s riskiest endeavors. Not only was it arguably a lot weirder than anything the MCU had attempted before, but Guardians Of The Galaxy was also adapted from a relatively obscure comic book series about a relatively unknown team of superheroes.

Luckily for Marvel, Peter Quill and his motley crew proved a big hit with audiences and Guardians Of The Galaxy went on to rank as 2014’s third highest-grossing film. The James Gunn-directed movie got a sequel – Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 2 – in 2017 and since then the GOTG team has appeared in other MCU movies like Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame.

With a third Guardians Of The Galaxy film right around the corner, no doubt those new or old to the MCU will want to re-watch the first movie but is it available on Netflix, Hulu, or Amazon Prime? Unfortunately, Netflix and Hulu members are out of luck as Guardians Of The Galaxy isn’t available via either streaming service. The movie is, however, on Amazon Prime to rent or buy and currently priced between $2.99 and $19.99 to watch in standard definition or HD.

The reason behind Guardians Of The Galaxy’s absence on Netflix is the launch of the House of Mouse’s new streaming service Disney+ in November 2019. Disney has been steadily removing its Marvel movies from Netflix in anticipation of the Disney+ launch for the past couple of years. So, while Guardians Of The Galaxy isn’t available on Netflix it is on Disney+ alongside its sequel Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 2 and a ton of other Marvel titles including Ant-Man, Doctor Strange and Captain Marvel. Other options for watching Guardians Of The Galaxy include YouTube Movies, Google Play, iTunes and the Microsoft Store where the film is easily available to rent or buy.

While Guardians Of The Galaxy may be unavailable for Netflix and Hulu subscribers, there’s still the upcoming release of Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol 3. to look forward to. The sequel is set to commence production once director James Gunn has finished working on the DCEU movie The Suicide Squad and is currently scheduled for release in 2021.

The rising popularity of transcription services are helping a lot of companies in terms of documentation and streamlining several of their processes. Converting audio recorded files into text documents can help you easily compile all critical information and load it in your company database. Doing this would make it easier for employees to search for answers and records rather than sorting it manually. With the help of companies that employ trained transcribers, you can do many things that can benefit your business in the long run. Document conversations If you want your business to become successful, touch base with your employees by setting weekly meetings to discuss productivity and opportunities. If you want everyone in the room to remember all the details that were discussed during the session, you must assign someone to do all of the note-taking. However, this task can take time to finish, plus you are also not sure about the accuracy of the collated information. Hiring a reputable transcription services company will help you get all the information that transpired during the meeting word by word. Improves video content If you are trying to sell a product or service to the public, it would be a great idea to upload video content or blogs on various online platforms like YouTube and social media.

Improves workplace efficiency All employees need to remain productive throughout the entire day inside the office. If you are about to start a substantial project, you should begin soliciting ideas and concepts ahead of time. Gather your team for a weekly brainstorming session to keep their creative juices flowing throughout the discussion.

You will be more confident that you now have all the necessary information to proceed with your next project. Lastly, hiring a transcription service company will help you save a lot of time and effort when it comes to proper documentation. Employees no longer need to render overtime to transcribe.

Este 22 de febrero habrá una marcha desde la Alta Comisión de Australia (la Casa de Australia) en Londres a la Plaza del Parlamento, el centro de la democracia británica. La gente cargará imágenes del editor y periodista australiano Julian Assange quien, el 24 de febrero, enfrentará un tribunal que decidirá si será o no extraditado a los Estados Unidos a una muerte en vida.

Conozco bien la Casa de Australia. Siendo australiano, solía ir en mis años de juventud en Londres a leer los periódicos de casa. Inaugurada por el Rey Jorge V hace más de un siglo atrás, su vastedad de mármol y granito, candelabros y retratos solemnes, importados de Australia cuando sus soldados morían en la carnicería de la Primera Guerra Mundial, han asegurado su lugar como referencia del servilismo monumental al imperio.

Como una de las “misiones diplomáticas” más antiguas en el Reino Unido, esta reliquia del imperio ofrece una sinecura placentera para los políticos en las antípodas: un “colega” premiado o un agitador exiliado.

Conocido como el Alto Comisionado, el equivalente de un embajador, el actual beneficiario es George Brandis, quien como Fiscal General intentó diluir la Ley de Discriminación Racial australiana y aprobó allanamientos a los informantes (whistleblowers) que revelaron la verdad sobre el espionaje ilegal de Australia sobre Timor Oriental durante las negociaciones para repartirse el petróleo y el gas de ese país empobrecido.

Esto condujo a las acusaciones contra los informantes Bernard Collaery y el “Testigo K” con falsos alegatos. Como Julian Assange, tienen que ser silenciados mediante un juicio kafkiano y luego encerrados.

La Casa de Australia es el punto de partida ideal para la marcha del sábado.

“Confieso”, escribó Lord Curzon, Virrey de India, en 1898, “que los países son como piezas sobre un tablero de ajedrez sobre los cuales se juega nuestro gran juego de dominación del mundo”.

Nosotros los australianos hemos estado al servicio del Gran Juego por demasiado tiempo. Habiendo devastado a nuestra población aborigen con una invasión y una guerra de desgaste que continúa hasta hoy en día, hemos derramado la sangre de nuestros amos imperiales en China, África, Rusia, el Medio Oriente, Europa y Asia. Ninguna aventura imperial contra quienes no tenemos ningún problema han escapado a nuestra dedicación.

El engaño ha sido nuestra principal característica. Cuando el primer ministro Robert Menzies en 1960 envió soldados australianos a Vietnam, los presentó como un equipo de entrenamiento, solicitado por el atribulado gobierno en Saigón. Era una mentira. Un funcionario de alto nivel del Departamento de Asuntos Exteriores escribió en secreto que “a pesar de haber insistido públicamente sobre el hecho de que nuestra asistencia fue dada en respuesta a una invitación del gobierno de Vietnam del Sur, la orden provino de Washington”.

Dos versiones. La mentira para nosotros, la verdad para ellos. Casi cuatro millones de personas murieron en la guerra de Vietnam.

Cuando Indonesia invadió Timor Oriental en 1975, Richard Woolcott, el embajador australiano, le urgió en secreto al gobierno de Camberra a “actuar de forma tal que pudiera quedar diseñado para minimizar el impacto público en Australia y demostrar a Indonesia comprensión en privado”. En otras palabras, mentir. Aludió al llamado por hacerse con el botín de petróleo y gas en el Mar de Timor, el cual vale “una millonada”, según se jactó el ministro de exteriores para ese momento, Gareth Evans.

Al menos 200 mil timorenses murieron en el genocidio que vino a continuación. Australia, prácticamente sola, reconoció la legitimidad de la ocupación.

Cuando el primer ministro John Howard envió fuerzas especiales australianas para la invasión de Irak junto a los Estados Unidos en Inglaterra en 2003, él mintió –al igual que George W. Bush y Tony Blair– diciendo que Saddam Hussein tenía armas de destrucción masiva. Más de un millón de personas murieron en Irak.

Wikileaks no ha sido la primera en denunciar el patrón de mentiras criminales en democracias que se conserva, en cada una de sus partículas, con la misma rapacidad que en los tiempos de Lord Curzon. El logro de la extraordinara organización fundada por Julian Assange ha estado presente para ofrecer las pruebas.

Wikileaks nos informó sobre cómo se fabrican las guerras ilegales, cómo los gobiernos son derrocados y se usa la violencia en nuestro nombre, cómo hemos espiado mediante nuestras pantallas y teléfonos. Ha expuesto las verdaderas mentiras de presidentes, embajadores, candidatos políticos, generales, intermediarios, estafadores políticos. Uno por uno, estos aspirantes a emperadores se han dado cuenta de que están desnudos.

Ha sido un servicio público sin precedentes; sobre todas las cosas, es periodismo auténtico, cuyo valor puede ser juzgado por el grado de apoplejía de los corruptos y sus apologistas.

En 2016, por ejemplo, Wikileaks publicó un correo filtrado de John Podesta, jefe de campaña de Hillary Clinton, revelando una conexión directa entre Clinton, la fundación que comparte con su esposo y el financiamiento del yijadismo organizado en el Medio Oriente. Terrorismo.

Un correo reveló que el Estado Islámico (ISIS) estaba en la nómina de los gobiernos de Arabia Saudita y Qatar, de quienes Clinton ha aceptado “donaciones” sustanciosas. Aún más, siendo Secretaria de Estado, aprobó la venta de armas más voluminosa del mundo a sus benfactores saudíes, por encima de los 80 mil millones de dólares. Gracias a ella, se duplicaron las ventas de armas estadounidenses en el mundo, para emplearla en países azotados por la pobreza como Yemen.

Revelados por Wikileaks y publicados por el New York Times, los correos de Podesta dispararon una campaña de vituperación contra su editor en jefe Julian Assange, careciendo de cualquier evidencia. Se dijo que era un “agente de Rusia trabajando para que Trump fuera electo”; y a continuación vino el sinsentido del Russiagate. Que Wikileaks también haya publicado más de 800 mil documentos que con frecuencia pudieran condenar al gobierno ruso es algo completamente ignorado.

En 2017, en un programa de la Corporación de Radiodifusión Australiana, llamado Cuatro Esquinas, Clinton fue entrevistada por Sarah Ferguson, quien así comenzó su entrevista: “Nadie puede evitar el sentirse movido por el dolor en tu rostro [en el momento de la inauguración del gobierno de Donald Trump]… ¿Recuerdas cuán visceral fue para ti?”.

Habiendo dejado establecido el sufrimiento visceral de Clinton, la aduladora Ferguson describió “el papel de Rusia” y el “daño que [Julian Assange] te hizo personalmente a ti”-

Clinton respondió, “Él, claramente, es un instrumento de la inteligencia rusa. Y les ha cumplido con sus servicios”.

Ferguson le dijo a Clinton, “mucha gente, incluyendo en Australia, creen que Assange es un mártir de la libertad de expresión e información. ¿Cómo lo describiría?”.

De nuevo, se le permitió a Clinton difamar a Assange –un “nihilista” al servicio de “dictadores– mientras Ferguson le aseguraba a su entrevistada que era el “icono de su generación”.

No hubo una sola mención a un documento filtrado, y revelado por Wikileaks, llamado Lybia Tick Tock, preparado por Hillary Clinton, que la describe como la figura central en la conducción de la destrucción del estado libio en 2011. El resultado de esto fue 40 mil muertes, la llegada del ISIS al norte de África y la crisis europea de refugiados y migrantes.

Para mí, este episodio de la entrevista a Clinton –hay muchos más– ilustra de forma vivaz la división entre el periodismo verdadero y el falso. El 24 de febrero, cuando Julian Assange entre al Tribunal de Woolwich Crown, será el periodismo genuino el único crimen verdadero que será juzgado.

A veces me preguntan por qué he defendido a Assange. En primer lugar, me agrada y lo admiro. Es un amigo con un coraje impresionante; y tiene un refinado, pulido y provocador sentido del humor. Es lo diametralmente opuesto al personaje que sus enemigos primero crearon y luego asesinaron.

Como periodista que ha estado en lugares turbulentos en todo el mundo, he aprendido a comparar la evidencia de lo que he testimoniado con las palabras y acciones de quienes están en el poder. De esta manera, es posible darle una dimensión a cómo nuestro mundo está controlado, dividido y manipulado, a cómo el lenguaje y el debate se distorsionan para producir la propaganda de la falsa consciencia..

Cuando hablamos sobre dictaduras, lo definimos como lavado cerebral: la conquista de nuestras mentes. Es una verdad que raramente se aplica a nuestras propias sociedades, a pesar del rastro de sangre que conduce directo a nosotros y que nunca se seca.

Esto lo ha divulgado Wikileaks. Este es el por qué Assange está en una prisión de máxima seguridad enfrentando cargos políticos inventados en los Estados Unidos, y el por qué él ha avergonzado a tantos que son pagados para mantener las cosas en su lugar. Miren cómo esos periodistas ahora buscan dónde cubrirse mientras sobre ellos madruga que los fascistas estadounidenses que vinieron por Assange luego irán por ellos, entre ellos aquellos en The Guardian que colaboraron con Wikileaks y ganaron premios además de asegurar contratos lucrativos con Hollywood y editoriales, basado en el trabajo de Assange, antes de entregarlo.

En 2011, el “editor de investigaciones” de The Guardian, David Leigh, le dijo a los estudiantes de periodismo de la Universidad de la City en London que Assange estaba “algo trastornado”. Cuando un estudiante desconcertado le pregunto por qué, Leigh respondió: “Porque no comprende los parámetros del periodismo convencional”.

Pero es precisamente porque sí entendió esos “parámetros” de los medios, frecuentemente investidos con protección e intereses políticos y teniendo poco que ver con transparencia, que las ideas de Wikileaks resultaban tan atractivas para tantas personas, especialmente los jóvenes, correctamente escépticos del llamado “mainstream”.

Leigh se burló de la idea de que Assange, una vez extraditado, terminase “vestido con un mono naranja”. Estas eran cosas, dijo, “que dicen él y su abogado para alimentar su paranoia”.

Los actuales cargos de los Estados Unidos contra Assange se centran en la “bitácora afgana” (Afghan Log) y la “bitácora iraquí” (Irak Log), que el Guardian publicó y sobre las que Leigh trabajó, además del video de “asesinato colateral” (Collateral Murder) que enseñaba a la tripulación de un helicóptero estadounidense ametrallando civiles y celebrando el crimen. Por este trabajo periodístico, Assange enfrenta 17 acusaciones de “espionaje” que conllevan sentencias de prisión que alcanzan los 175 años.

Independientemente de si su uniforme en la cárcel sea o no un “mono naranja”, los archivos del tribunal estadounidense que sus abogados lograron examinar revelan que, una vez extraditado, Assange será objeto de Medidas Administrativas Especiales, conocidas como SAMS (en inglés).

Un informe de la Escuela de Derecho de la Universidad de Yale y el Centro por los Derechos Constitucionales de 2017 describen a las SAMS como “la esquina más oscura del sistema federal de prisiones de los Estados Unidos”, que combinan “la brutalidad y el aislamiento de las unidades de máxima seguridad con las restricciones adicionales que le niegan a los individuos casi cualquier conexión con el mundo humano… el resultado de esto es el de escudar esta forma de tortura de cualquier escrutinio público”.

Que Assange haya tenido la razón todo este tiempo, y el llevarlo a Suecia haya sido un fraude para encubrir el plan norteamericano de “reducirlo”, finalmente está dejando claro para muchos que tragaron el chisme incesante, típico del asesinato de personaje.

“Hablo sueco fluido y pude leer los documentos originales”, dijo recientemente Nils Melzer, el Relator de las Naciones Unidas para la Tortura. “Y difícilmente podía creerlo. De acuerdo al testimonio de la mujer en cuestión, no hubo violación. Y no sólo eso: el testimonio de la mujer luego fue modificado por la Policía de Estocolmo sin siquiera ella saberlo para poder, de alguna forma, hacerlo sonar como posible violación. Tengo todos los documentos en mi poder, los correos, los mensajes de texto”.

Actualmente, Keir Starmer está lanzando su candidatura a la dirección del Partido Laborista de Inglaterra. Entre 2008 y 2013, fue el Director de la Fiscalía Pública y el responsable del Servicio de Fiscales de la Corona (CPS, por sus siglas en inglés). De acuerdo a investigaciones basadas en la figura de la Libertad de Información, realizadas por la periodista italiana Stefania Maurizi, Suecia trató de desistir en el caso de Assange en 2011, pero un funcionario de la CPS en Londres le dijo al fiscal sueco que no tratara este asunto como “cualquier otra extradición”.

En 2012, recibió un correo de la CPS: “¡No te eches para atrás!!!”.

Otros correos del CPS fueron o bien suprimidos o bien censurados. ¿Por qué? Keir Starmer tiene que decir el porqué.

A la vanguardia de la marcha del sábado estará John Shipton, el padre de Julian, cuyo apoyo infatigable por su hijo es la antítesis de la complicidad y la crueldad de los sucesivos gobiernos de Australia, nuestra tierra natal.

La lista de la vergüenza comienza con Julia Gillard, la primera ministra laborista australiana que, en 2010, quería criminalizar a Wikileaks, arrestar a Assange y cancelar su pasaporte, hasta que la Policía Federal australiana señaló que ninguna ley permitía eso y que Assange no había cometido crimen alguno.

Mientras que falsamente alegaba el darle asistencia consular en Londres, fue el sorprendente abandono del gobierno de Gillard de uno de sus ciudadanos lo que condujo a Ecuador a concederle asilo político a Assange en su embajada en Londres.

En un discurso subsiguiente ante el congreso de los Estados Unidos, Gillard, una favorita de la embajada de los Estados Unidos en Camberra, superó el récord de adulación (de acuerdo al portal Honest History) mientras declaraba una y otra vez, la fidelidad de los “colegas” australianos a los Estados Unidos.

Hoy en día, mientras Assange espera en su celda, Gillard viaja por el mundo, promocionándose a sí misma como una feminista preocupada por los “derechos humanos”, a veces en tándem con otra súper feminista, llamada Hillary Clinton.

Lo cierto es que Australia podía haber rescatado a Julian Assange y todavía puede hacerlo.

En 2010, organicé una reunión con un miembro Liberal (conservador) del Parlamento: Malcolm Turnbull. Siendo un joven abogado en los 80, Turnbull exitosamente combatió contra los intentos del gobierno británico de evitar la publicación del libro Spycatcher (“Atrapa espías”), cuyo autor, Peter Wright, un espía, había expuesto al “estado profundo” británico.

Hablamos sobre su famosa victoria por la libertad de expresión y publicación y le describí el error judicial en materia de justicia que esperaba por Assange: el fraude de su arresto en Suecia y la conexión con una sentencia que destrozaba a la constitución de los Estados Unidos además de la autoridad de la legislación internacional.

Turnbull parecía demostrar un interés genuino y un asistente tomo notas de forma extensiva. Le pedí que entregara una carta al gobierno australiano firmada por Gareth Peirce, el renombrado abogado británico especializado en derechos humanos que representa a Assange.

En la carta, Peirce escribió: “Dada la amplitud de la discusión pública, frecuentemente basada en suposiciones completamente falsas… es difícil el intentar preservar cualquier presunción de inocencia [para Julian Assange]. Sobre el señor Assange ahora penden no una sino dos espadas de Damocles, dos potenciales extradiciones de dos jurisdicciones distintas por dos presuntos crímenes diferentes, ninguno de los cuales son delitos en su propio país, y que su seguridad personal estaba en riesgo en circunstancias con una pesada carga politizada”.

Turnbull prometió entregar la carta, hacerle seguimiento e informarme. Luego le escribí en varias oportunidades, esperé y nunca llegó nada.

En 2018, John Shipton escribió una carta profundamente conmovedora al para entonces primer ministro de Australia solicitándole el ejercer el poder diplomático a disposición de su gobierno para devolver a Julian a casa. Escribió que temía que de no ser Julian rescatado, ocurriría una tragedia y que su hijo moriría en prisión. No recibió respuesta alguna. Ese primer ministro era Malcolm Turnbull.

El año pasado, cuando el actual primer ministro, Scott Morrison, un antiguo hombre de las relaciones públicas, se le preguntó por Assange, respondió en su forma acostumbrada, “¡Tiene que hacerse cargo de sus cosas!”.

Cuando la marcha del sábado llegue a Westminster, que según se dice es “la madre de todos los parlamentos”, Morrison y Gillard y Turnbull y todos aquellos que han traicionado a Julian Assange deberían ser señalados; la historia y la decencia no los olvidarán, tampoco a aquellos que hoy en día permanecen en silencio.

Y de todavía quedar algo de sentido de justicia en la tierra de la Magna Carta, la farsa que es el caso contra este australiano heroico debe ser rechazada. O, de lo contrario, todos tendremos que tener cuidado.",https://web.archive.org/web/20220616070451id_/https://thegrayzone.com/2020/02/26/john-pilger-julian-assange-liberado-traicionado/,,,"['Wikileaks', 'Julian Assange']"

The RAF ran a UFO unit for five decades but chose to shut it down in 2009 after it concluded none of the reports sent in offered evidence of a potential threat.

Previously, records from the unit were given to the National Archives, often initially classified before being released after a specific number of years.

But the most recent reports received by the RAF will be placed online, the PA news agency revealed following a Freedom of Information Act request.

Members of the public reporting alleged UFO sightings are now directed to their local police force.

A spokesman for the RAF said that ""it had been assessed that it would be better to publish these records, rather than continue sending documents to the National Archives, and so they are looking to put them on to a dedicated gov.uk web page"".

A clearance process for the documents is currently under way before publication, which is expected to take place ""some time within the first quarter of 2020"".

In response to the FOI request, the RAF described the files it held as ""comprising entirely of correspondence with members of the public"".

It added: ""The MoD has no opinion on the existence or otherwise of extra terrestrial life and does not investigate UFO reports.""

Nick Pope, who used to investigate reports of UFO sightings for the MoD, welcomed the move.

""Given the massive public interest in this subject, I'm pleased that these files will be released and made available online,"" he told the PA news agency.

""The MoD have previously claimed that all the files have been released - only to find additional ones - so this latest move is bound to start a few conspiracy theories.

""When I worked on the MoD's 'UFO desk' we didn't find definitive proof of extraterrestrial visitation, but there were so many bizarre and unexplained sightings that we didn't entirely rule it out.

""I'm glad the public are to be given further insights into our work on these real-life X-Files.""

The Rendlesham Forest incident: Britain’s most famous UFO sighting The Rendlesham Forest incident took place in December 1980 over a series of at least two nights. On December 26, 1980, military personnel at the twin bases of RAF Bentwaters and RAF Woodbridge in Suffolk saw a strange light in Rendlesham Forest, which lies between the two bases. Three men were sent out to investigate where two of them encountered a small, triangularshaped craft. One man, Jim Penniston, got close enough to touch the side of the object. He and another of the airmen present, John Burroughs, made sketches of the craft for witness statements. Two nights later Deputy Base Commander, Lieutenant Colonel Charles Halt and his team then encountered the UFO. He said later: ""Here I am, a senior official who routinely denies this sort of thing and diligently works to debunk them, and I'm involved in the middle of something I can't explain.""

Despite an MOD investigation the Rendlesham Forest incident remains unexplained.

You’ve finally secured a new job, and now you want to start off on the right foot, making a positive impression on your new boss and…","You’ve finally secured a new job, and now you want to start off on the right foot, making a positive impression on your new boss and colleagues.

You want to be careful not to make any career-ending mistakes, says recruitment specialist, Glassdoor.

So, what should you never do when starting a new job?

Here are 10 things to avoid:

1. Don’t show up late.

You learned this in first grade, when the teacher began keeping track of tardies: Being on time matters. Especially in a new job. In fact, showing up late on the first day (or even in the first few weeks) is guaranteed to make a negative impression.

To ensure you’ll be on time, test drive the route to your new job before you start so you’ll know how long it takes to get there. Factor in extra time if there’s traffic, construction, or other reasons to expect a delay.

2. Don’t dress unprofessionally.

Before starting your job, talk with the hiring manager or human resources professional to make sure you understand what constitutes acceptable attire for your new workplace.

There’s nothing more embarrassing than showing up in a getup that doesn’t fly with your supervisors — and making an unprofessional first impression.

3. Don’t blow off orientation.

Many companies require new employees to go through an orientation or training process before starting a new position. While it may be tempting to skip these sessions or treat them lightly, don’t do it.

Even if your training managers won’t be your direct supervisors, they are watching you. Avoid any behavior that could prompt a training manager to report your behavior back to your boss and team members.

4. Don’t expect hand-holding.

No matter where you’re working, there are certain processes, tools, and forms that make up the standard operating procedures of your company.

You may have been introduced to these through a very organized, systematic orientation, or you may feel like you’re expected to absorb them by osmosis.

If you were formally informed, “consider yourself fortunate,” writes Heather Huhman, Glassdoor career and workplace expert.

“If not, don’t feel shortchanged or frustrated. Instead, take initiative and master the basics on your own.”

5. Don’t ask co-workers to do your work.

It’s understandable that you may need help or guidance during your first few weeks at a new job, and asking co-workers for assistance or just to answer questions can be perfectly acceptable.

But there’s no quicker way to make enemies than to ask or expect your new co-workers to do your job for you.

Remember, you were hired because managers believed in your ability to get the job done. Ask for help if you need it, but believe in yourself and prove that you can do the work yourself.

6. Don’t take too many personal calls.

The time you spend at work is for, well, work. Your employer isn’t paying you to chat with your girlfriend or even your kids’ babysitter.

If friends or family members are prone to call you during working hours, remind them before you start your new job that you will now be working during certain hours and request that they avoid calling you during those hours.

Make a personal policy of limiting personal phone calls and texts to your lunch break, except for during emergencies.

7. Don’t ask for more money.

Most likely, you and your employer agreed to a certain salary during the hiring process. So don’t change your mind before you even show up at work. If you agreed to the salary offered, be satisfied with that.

Don’t expect more money (and don’t ask for more) until you’ve worked long enough to prove your value to the employer.

8. Don’t try to change things.

Of course you want to make a good impression as soon as you arrive at a new job, and show your new employer they made the right choice in hiring you.

However, be cautious of suggesting new policies or strategies during your first few weeks, as it may not be the best way to demonstrate you are a team player. Plus, it could prompt some of your new co-workers to think twice about you as the right person for the job.

At first, take time to really understand and learn your job, then over time, you can make suggestions and changes as situations arise, and as your input and expertise is called upon.

9. Don’t be dishonest.

In a new job, there will always be a learning curve, and effective supervisors understand that. Inevitably, you’ll be asked to do something or expected to know something that you don’t yet know or know how to do. Rather than saying you can complete the task on your own, be honest. “Don’t be afraid to say, ‘I don’t know,’” Huhman writes.

“Honesty is a huge differentiator. Simply look people in the eye and say unabashedly and with confidence, “I don’t know. Let me find out and get back to you. Then do it.”

10. Don’t be afraid to ask for help.

You may be so eager to start your new job that you don’t want to stop and ask questions. But by skipping even the most basic questions, you are setting yourself up for failure.

Rather than making a mistake that could cost the company time and money, ask questions about everything you need to know, from what your job responsibilities are to who can help you with Internet or phone problems, to how you get paid and much more.

By following these tips from Glassdoor, you’ll be on your way to keeping your job and impressing your boss and co-workers.

Great British Bake Off bosses have released a statement which hints at Sandi Toksvig's real reason for quitting the show.

The 61-year-old broadcaster has hosted the Channel 4 series alongside Noel Fielding for three years, but stunned fans today by declaring she is stepping down.

The producers paid tribute to Sandi, thanking her for her hard work on the show and telling her she would be missed.

Ian Katz, Director of Programmes at Channel 4, revealed she actually has upcoming voiceover projects in the pipeline with the network.

”Sandi is a huge part of why Bake Off’s move to Channel 4 has been such a success and we are immensely grateful for her contribution to the show,"" he said in his statement.

""We will miss her warmth and wit, not to mention her endless willingness to be the butt of jokes about being the least tall person in the Bake Off tent.

""Fortunately, her unique voice will continue to have an important presence on the Channel with new shows in development - none of which involve cake.”

Meanwhile, Chief Creative Officer and Executive Producer for Love Productions, Richard McKerrow, said: “We’ll always be incredibly grateful to Sandi for becoming one of the hosts of Bake Off when we moved to Channel 4, along with Noel, Paul and Prue.

Since its inception in 2008 with The Incredible Hulk and Iron Man, the MCU has been on a steady incline as its popularity spreads across the globe and its box-offices continue to rise.

To this day, the MCU has amassed an unbelievable $22.5 billion at the box-office with the average per film being a remarkable $980.5 million. While there is a spectrum regarding the 'success' of each of the MCU films, there has yet to be a flop or a 'box-office bomb'. No MCU film has had a 'rotten' rating according to Rotten Tomatoes and even the least commercially successful film still brought in a respectable $260 million. (Worldwide box office presented in parentheses.)

23 The Incredible Hulk ($263,427,551)

via ew.com

While its MCU-integration is fairly questionable, 2008’s The Incredible Hulk is technically considered one of the first MCU film. Starring the talented Edward Norton, the film was a decent showing of Bruce Banner’s struggle with his other angrier and destructive half and helped to kick-off one of the most successful film studios of all-time.

22 Captain America: The First Avenger ($370,569,774)

Via: hollywoodreporter.com

The first Captain America film was a breath of fresh air, jumping back in time and being a period piece set during the second world war. This origin story of Cap consequently has a distinct tone compared to other MCU films, and was a strong foundational piece in the story of Cap and the burgeoning MCU.

21 Thor ($449,326,618)

via youtube.com

Another more ‘out-there’ MCU entry, the first Thor film went for a more Shakespearean feel for its Norse mythological tale. While its mix of elements of godlike royalty and rural USA didn’t always mesh well, the film still did well in establishing the Thunder God’s core plight and cast of supporting characters.

20 Ant-Man ($519,311,965)

via The Verge

Ant-Man has never been the most popular Marvel hero, however the studio did wise in narrowing the scope of his first solo film, creating an insular heist-like MCU movie based around the ever-charismatic Paul Rudd as Scott Lang. Pairing him with Michael Douglas, Evangeline Lilly, and Michael Pena helped to make Ant-Man a still-decent success.

19 Ant-Man And The Wasp ($622,674,139)

via Time

Even if it’s not by a wide margin, it’s always a good sign when a sequel does better and not worse than its predecessor. Ant-Man and the Wasp ever so slightly expanded on Scott Lang’s world, now bringing Evangeline Lilly’s Hope van Dyne (aka the Wasp) in as his superhero partner. Plus, with additions in Michelle Pfeiffer and Laurence Fishburne, this sequel suddenly had a lot going for it.

18 Iron Man ($585,174,222)

via youtube.com

The film that truly kickstarted the MCU, 2008’s Iron Man really was a pivotal moment in cinematic history. Robert Downey Jr.’s perfect casting and portrayal of the charismatic yet deeply-flawed Tony Stark set a new precedent for superheroes and comic book movies alike. Many still see this film as the best of the MCU to-date.

17 Thor: The Dark World ($644,571,402)

via amazon.com

Thor’s sequel film is generally regarded as one of the weaker MCU instalments. However, as is the case here, sequels still often do better than their predecessors thanks to a growing fanbase for the franchise/characters. The Dark World still had some good action and eventually would play an important early role in the lead up to the Infinity Stone saga.

16 Doctor Strange ($677,718,395)

via twitter.com

The Sorcerer Supreme’s film was one of the significant character debuts of MCU’s Phase Three. Doctor Strange introduced the mystical side of Marvel that, in combination with the ever-great Benedict Cumberbatch, led to a strong debut for Doctor Strange. Fans have been waiting a long time now for the doctor’s second outing.

15 Iron Man 2 ($623,933,331)

Via Collider.com

Iron Man has always been one of the largest MCU box-office draws. While his second film was not altogether the best, the film still ratcheted up the action and the stakes enough to surpass the revenue of the first film. Adding another Iron Man (War Machine) and some memorable villains was enough to make Iron Man 2 a resounding success.

14 Captain America: The Winter Soldier ($714,264,267)

via youtube.com

The Winter Soldier was the MCU’s attempt at a semi-political thriller – a somewhat risky move for a studio making superhero films. However, this film ended up receiving rave reviews and is generally regarded as one of the best films of the entire MCU. With a co-starring role for Black Widow, Fury, Falcon, and the new enigmatic & dangerous Winter Soldier, Cap’s second film did remarkably well.

13 Guardians Of The Galaxy ($773,328,629)

via: denofgeek.com

Guardians of the Galaxy was the first major risk for Marvel. They banked an entire film on a pretty much unknown group of characters and set it in space where the film would have more-or-less no connections to the rest of the MCU. However, writer/director James Gunn ended up with a grand slam, instantly rocketing the Guardians family into stardom thanks to this action-packed, hilarious, and heartfelt film.

12 Thor: Ragnarok ($853,977,126)

Via TheVerge.com

After the poorly received The Dark World, Thor: Ragnarok changed up the formula of the Thor franchise drastically. Bringing on the eccentric Taika Waititi, Ragnarok ended up being a zany sci-fi adventure for the God of Thunder and his angry buddy, the Hulk, as they became trapped on a distant gladiatorial planet. The film was a massive success both commercially and with the critics.

11 Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 ($863,756,051)

via: marvel.com

Guardians Vol. 2 didn’t shake things up much from the first volume, but simply carried on the adventures of this spacefaring team. Luckily, the old mantra of “don’t fix what ain’t broken” served the film well, and the Guardians' now-enormous fanbase flocked out for this bigger and better sequel.

via Moviedash

There probably isn’t a person alive who doesn’t know the name ‘Spider-Man’. The old wallcrawler is arguably Marvel’s most recognizable & profitable character and so it was bound to be big news (and big money) when Sony finally agreed to terms to allow Spidey to enter the MCU. With a high school based story, the great Michael Keaton as the Vulture, and relative newcomer Tom Holland as Peter Parker, the film was a massive success.

9 Captain Marvel ($1,128,275,794)

via BGR

It took far too long for Marvel to come out with its first female-led superhero film. Luckily, it did eventually happen with the powerful Carol Danvers, aka Captain Marvel, at the helm. Played by Academy Award winner Brie Larson, the film was successful on every front and incredibly cracked the $1 billion box-office mark.

8 Spider-Man: Far From Home ($1,131,927,996)

via vox.com

More Spider-Man = more money. The most recent MCU film has continued the studio’s upward trend of increased box-office. Far From Home continued from where Homecoming left off with Peter’s class going on a European school trip where Spidey finds himself face-to-face with Mysterio played by Jake Gyllenhaal.

7 Captain America: Civil War ($1,153,304,495)

Via: youtube.com

Civil War was, in all respects, pretty much an Avengers film. Containing almost all of the core members (minus Thor and Hulk), this film had the massive fan draw of seeing our Marvel heroes finally go toe-to-toe with one another. If that wasn’t enough, it also introduced the likes of both Spider-Man and Black Panther into the MCU. Now, really, who wouldn’t pay to see that?

6 Iron Man 3 ($1,214,811,252)

Via PopSugar.com

The box-office increase from Iron Man 2 to 3 is quite remarkable with Iron Man’s final solo film more-or-less doubling its predecessor. While the film had some criticisms for its red herring portrayal of infamous Iron Man villain, The Mandarin, it was still an exciting film and steps above the dismal Iron Man 2.

5 Black Panther ($1,346,913,161)

via Vox

Like Captain Marvel, Black Panther was a necessary addition to the MCU and one that helped to address issues of representation within the franchise. On top of that important facet, Black Panther was, in almost every way, a fantastic film and it currently holds the highest MCU rotten tomatoes rating of 97%. This is another film whose sequel is highly anticipated.

4 Avengers: Age Of Ultron ($1,405,403,694)

via reddit.com

If there’s one thing that’s going to make big money at the box office, it’s having a film with ‘Avengers’ in its name. The first Avengers sequel maintained the momentum of the original with the same core team and writer/director, Joss Whedon, albeit with a few new additions in Scarlet Witch, Quicksilver, Vision, and the villainous Ultron. While it wasn’t nearly as popular with the critics, it still definitely made the big bucks.

3 The Avengers ($1,518,812,988)

via medium.com

The original MCU team-up and a pivotal moment in film history. The film that was the culmination of multiple years of set up, bringing together characters from various franchises in a way that likely hadn’t been seen since the 1930’s Universal monster films. The Avengers was a momentous success and cemented the MCU as the film-powerhouse that it is today.

2 Avengers: Infinity War ($2,048,359,754)

via vox.com

Infinity War was the first half of the gigantic climax of the first three Phases of the MCU. It was like the original Avengers on steroids with its culmination of a decade’s worth of films, pulling together characters from every MCU film while also introducing new ones like Thanos and his Black Order. This was the beginning of a film event like never before seen.

1 Avengers: Endgame ($2,797,800,564)

Via rollingstone.com

The big kahuna! Endgame – the film that broke every film record in existence. Not only was Endgame the final chapter in MCU’s first ‘lifespan’ but it was also a rollercoaster of a film with major twists, action, and ramifications for the numerous MCU heroes within. The film also provided a tangible gut punch for fans as they had to say goodbye to some of the now-most famous and beloved film heroes of all-time. Endgame truly had it all!

3254,1553161441,['Lee H. Hamilton'],Hamilton column: What Congress represents,en,,,,,"In one of the U.S. Capitol hallways that House members pass through regularly to get to the chambers, there’s an inscription of a comment by Alexander Hamilton. It comes from his 1788 remarks to the New York convention on ratifying the Constitution, and reads simply, “Here, Sir, the people govern.”

I’ve always thought that was a pretty good summation of what Congress represents: it is a repository of the thoughts and will of the American people. And my impression is that a lot of Americans think highly of that idea, too.

I’ve held a lot of public meetings over the years, and even in recent times, when Congress’s public standing has been low, people often speak approvingly of the history of the institution itself; they’re disappointed in how Congress performs, not in its role within our system. In all that time, I can’t ever remember anyone saying we’d be better off without it.

My experience in the House bore that belief out. Though there were always flaws, the process the House followed was focused on deliberation, debate, discussion … and then choosing a solution based more often than not on a rough consensus of its members. Even if I didn’t agree with the results, I’d often listen to the debates and think, “I like the way this institution works.”

I still remember the time that Wilbur Mills, the powerful chair of the House Ways and Means Committee, came before the Democratic caucus to talk about the upcoming vote on establishing Medicare. I was a new, young representative, and when Mills told us that we easily had enough votes to ram the measure through over Republican objections, I and many others thought we should do exactly that.

Mills, however, did not. He asked us to give him an opportunity to negotiate with Republicans and find ground that both sides could agree on, so that the bill could win support on both sides of the aisle. And that is exactly what he did.

Mills knew something that often gets forgotten these days, which is that the more broadly a piece of legislation reflects the American people, the greater its acceptability, effectiveness and staying power.

If you’re in Congress, you’re reminded pretty much every day that giving a say to this diverse country is a choice. The body is made up of members who fiercely advocate for their views through speeches, contacts of all kinds and descriptions, public appearances and trying to win the media over to their side. And the whole institution is a focal point for competing interests weighing in on difficult problems. It is a real cauldron.

All of these beliefs are represented in the Congress, and the legislative process is a key part of how the country works through that cacophony of competing interests. Debate, deliberation, calculation, compromise — it’s an inefficient process that, for difficult issues, can go on for a long time. But over the course of our history, it’s been reasonably productive.

This is why those of us who value the institution of the Congress — who actually believe in Hamilton’s words — have lamented the trend of recent decades ceding power to the presidency.

The Constitution is explicit: legislative power is vested in Congress. But if that power is not protected or goes unused, it does not merely evaporate; in our system, it flows to the presidency or the judiciary. And in doing so, it passes out of the hands of the body that most closely represents the American people.

When President Trump talks of the presidency as if there were no check on it, as if, as president, he is beyond the reach of the law or of Congress, members of Congress on both sides of the aisle rightly disagree. Sometimes they serve effectively as a check, sometimes not. Sometimes partisanship gets the better of them.

But for better or worse, Congress remains the spot where the cross-currents of American popular opinion have their best chance of being heard, listened to and acted upon. That’s one power members should never give up.

Michigan Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s administration has requested an emergency supply of the drugs President Trump touted as having success treating patients with severe symptoms of the novel coronavirus, in a reversal from the state’s directive to medical professionals last week to avoid the medication for this purpose.

Michigan, this week, requested hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine from the Strategic National Stockpile for physicians to use to help treat patients with COVID-19, after the Food and Drug Administration over the weekend granted an emergency use authorization for the anti-malarial drugs.

But last week, Whitmer’s administration threatened physicians prescribing the drugs, saying they were subject to “administrative action” should they continue to use the medication.

Video above: World War II veteran busts a move in quarantine A 99-year-old World War II veteran who survived the coronavirus has been given a guard of honor by nurses as he was discharged from hospital.Albert Chambers, who will turn 100 in July, recovered from the virus at Tickhill Road Hospital in Doncaster, northern England.Chambers was admitted to the hospital three weeks ago after injuring his wrist in a fall. While there, he began to show symptoms of COVID-19 and tested positive for the virus.But, despite the fears of his family, he recovered, and nurses at the hospital saw him off with a guard of honor — a moment that was captured on video and shared on social media by the NHS Northeast and Yorkshire health trust.""Thank you very much, I appreciate every bit you've done for me. It couldn't have been better,"" Chambers, who has lived alone since his wife's death almost two decades ago, tells one of the nurses in the video.His grandson, 49-year-old Stephen Gater, told CNN how the family had expected the worst after being told he had contracted COVID-19. But, he said, he believed his grandfather's ""fortitude"" — gained during his time as a British Army soldier during World War II — helped pull him through.During the war, Chambers was captured by the enemy after being injured in a bomb blast in North Africa. He was transferred to Fallingbostel in northwestern Germany, where he spent three years as a prisoner of war in its Stalag XI B camp.After the war, he protected London's royal palaces as a soldier in the Coldstream Guards.""It's nice to have some positive news in the midst of what is a difficult time for everybody,"" Gater told CNN.""When we heard the news, we feared the worst but he's pulled through and it's amazing — the staff there are incredible and we owe them a huge amount of gratitude. We were clapping very ferociously last night at 8 o'clock along with everyone else.""It's testament to the care he was getting and his positive attitude and his fortitude.""One thing Chambers will have missed, Gater said, was his ""guilty secret"" — a daily trifle bought from the supermarket Marks & Spencer.""I'm just driving up and I've literally just stopped at a service station and bought him a load — so hopefully that'll put a smile on his face,"" he said.",https://www.wpbf.com/article/99-year-old-world-war-ii-veteran-who-survived-coronavirus-gets-guard-of-honor-from-nurses/32107269,,,
3370,1484037143,['Associated Press'],Jahanbakhsh nets overhead kick as Brighton holds Chelsea 1-1,en,,,,%,"BRIGHTON, England (AP) — Alireza Jahanbakhsh’s acrobatic overhead kick gave Brighton a 1-1 draw with Chelsea in the Premier League on New Year’s Day.

The Iran striker’s bicycle kick in the 84th minute punished Frank Lampard’s wasteful Chelsea, which relied on goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga’s late save against Neal Maupay to avoid losing.

Jahanbakhsh started 2020 in style after only breaking a 20-match league goal drought in the 2-0 win over Bournemouth on Saturday.

The goal on Wednesday canceled out the tap-in from Chelsea captain Cesar Azpilicueta in the 10th minute.

Christian Pulisic will look at three wasted openings that ultimately stopped Chelsea cementing their dominance, denying the fourth-place side another away victory after Sunday’s 2-1 win at Arsenal.

The American dragged a shot wide from a well-worked and promising position.

The forward had tormented Martin Montoya throughout the first half and outfoxed him twice in quick succession after the break, but he failed to find the target on both occasions.

Dominic Raab is deputising for Boris Johnson while he battles coronavirus (PA)

The rapid deterioration of Boris Johnson’s condition as he battles Covid-19 has thrust his de facto deputy Dominic Raab into the spotlight, but who is the man now effectively running the country?

The Foreign Secretary has enjoyed a swift rise to the top. Three years ago he wasn’t even in Cabinet, but the hard-Brexiteer, karate-loving 46-year-old former lawyer has long-been eyeing the top job.

Clearly he would not have wanted it this way, but he will be well-prepared to take on his boss’s responsibilities.

The son of a Czech-born Jewish refugee who fled the Nazis in 1938, Raab become involved in martial arts to help cope with the death of his father from cancer when he was just 12.

“Sport helped restore my confidence, and that hugely benefited my attitude to school and life”, he said last year.

Brought up in Buckinghamshire, he went to Dr Challoner’s Grammar School before studying law at Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford, where he captained the university karate team and was a boxing blue, and then a Masters at Cambridge, winning the Clive Parry Prize for International Law.

He started his career as an international lawyer at Linklaters in the City, but was also seconded to the human rights NGO Liberty, and worked for one of the principal Palestinian negotiators of the Oslo peace accords.

In 2000 he joined the diplomatic service and was part of the Foreign & Commonwealth Office’s legal team, and it was there he met his now-wife Erika Ray, a Brazilian marketing executive.

The couple and their two sons, Peter and Joshua, live in Thames Ditton, Surrey.

In 2003 Raab was posted to The Hague and worked to bring war criminals like Radovan Karadzic and Charles Taylor to justice, and ended up defending Tony Blair from a subpoena by the former Yugoslav president Slobodan Milošević.

He caught the eye of Shadow Home Secretary David Davis, who poached him to be his chief of staff in 2006, and three years later he went to work for the then-Shadow Justice Secretary Dominic Grieve, but it soon became clear he was more on the DD wing of the Tory party when it came to the EU.

In 2010 he was elected to the safe Surrey commuter seat of Esher and Walton, but spent the first five years in Parliament on the backbenches, often finding himself at odds with Theresa May - who was then Home Secretary - on the issues of civil liberties.

After David Cameron’s general election victory in 2015, Raab was made a junior minister, and then played a prominent role in the Brexit campaign, but was sacked by Mrs May when she took over in the wake of the EU referendum.

She brought him back as a justice minister a year later, before promoting him to housing minister in January 2018.

He entered Cabinet in July that year after his old mentor Mr Davis quit as Brexit Secretary, but he followed suit after just four months later, saying ""in good conscience"" he could not support the Northern Irish backstop arrangement in Mrs May's deal.

Some accused him of only taking the role to help sabotage May and boost his career, something his supporters denied, but six months later he was in the running to replace her as PM after she agreed to stand down.

But he finished a disappointing sixth in the leadership contest, getting knocked out in the second ballot after only receiving the support of 30 Tory MPs.

In the following round the man who finished above him, Rory Stewart, lost 10 votes, prompting speculation Johnson’s team may have lent him votes to help eliminate his Brexiteer rival.

Nevertheless, he endorsed Boris as soon as he was eliminated, and seemed destined for a top job in his Cabinet after he defeated Jeremy Hunt in the final round of voting by Tory members.

But it was still a relative surprise to see him made Foreign Secretary, and also designated as First Secretary of State, placing him at the very top of the Cabinet rankings below the PM.

In the short time since he has struggled to make his mark in the FCO, and has faced criticism amid the transatlantic fall-out over the death of British teenager Harry Dunn, but is seen as extremely capable and unflappable, if somewhat of a hard taskmaster.

He has been dogged by accusations of bullying stemming from an incident in 2007, when an employee made a claim against him which went to an employment tribunal, and was settled confidentially.

After details were printed in 2011 by the Mail on Sunday he took the newspaper to court and it was forced to apologise, and last year he said of the incident: “I vigorously denied the claims, which were independently investigated and found to be unsubstantiated.

""The claim that I secured an injunction or any kind of ‘gagging’ order is false.”

He was also loosely entangled in a scandal when his diary secretary was found to have been selling sex on a ‘sugar daddy’ website in 2018, but the most damaging revelation about him from the story was that he eats the same lunch every single day from Pret a Manger.

Ever since then a chicken caesar and bacon baguette, superfruit pot and ‘vitamin volcano’ smoothie combination has been known as the ‘Dom Raab Special’ in Westminster circles, despite his denial he lacks variety in his mealtime habits.

And he has been involved in a few other embarrassing moments, after he said that he ""hadn't quite understood the full extent"" of how much UK trade relies on the Dover-Calais crossing, and later confusing the Irish Sea with the Red Sea at a select committee hearing.

His comments about feminists - calling them “obnoxious bigots” - have also drawn criticism, including from his old adversary Mrs May, who suggested it was “not the way forward”.

But the focus is a long way from that now as takes on his duties standing in for the PM in the coming days.

Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove was quick to point out that Cabinet makes collective decisions, and that Mr Raab will not enjoy the untrammelled power a full-time PM might expect.

The comments were not all that surprising given the pair have a tricky relationship, after Mr Gove’s team blamed the Raab campaign for cocaine use scandal which derailed his own bid to be Tory leader.

The pair must now work closely together to help steer the country’s response to the coronavirus crisis and fill the void left by the PM, but the black-belt third dan is used to fighting his corner.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has promised to stand in solidarity with the United States in its struggle against the coronavirus pandemic and as it recovers from the outbreak.

In a letter sent to President Donald Trump Erdogan also said he was following with appreciation the American leaders efforts to control the outbreak.

The letter was sent Tuesday along with a planeload of personal protective equipment that Turkey donated to the US It was made public on Wednesday.

Erdogan wrote, “I am very pleased to observe that thanks to your measures America has taken the first steps towards normalization by achieving a downward trend in the number of new cases.

“You can be sure as a reliable and strong partner of the US we will continue to demonstrate solidarity in every way possible,” Erdogan wrote.

Turkey sent 500,000 surgical masks, 4,000 overalls, 2,000 liters 528 gallons of disinfectant, 1,500 goggles, 400 N95 masks and 500 face shields. Turkey has sent similar medical equipment aid to a total of 55 countries — including Britain Italy and Spain.

Erdogan and Trump have maintained a close personal relationship despite a series of differences between Ankara and Washington including policy on Syria and Turkeys decision to purchase the S400 Russian missile defense system that the US says poses a threat to its F35 stealth fighter jets and to NATO.

Rio Tinto plans to roll out the same process at Geraldton and Albany airports in coming weeks after a successful five-layer screening process which has been in place at Perth Airport since last month.

The Busselton, Geraldton and Albany airports are some of the company’s busiest transport hubs, with 900 FIFO workers expected to pass through the airports every fortnight.

Rio Tinto now requires its FIFO workers to arrive at least 30 minutes prior to scheduled departure times to allow for the screening, which is overseen by the company’s occupational physician.

It includes online and face to face health questionnaires, temperature checks and a rapid finger prick blood screen that’s performed by a nurse to detect viral antibodies.

While this is not a diagnostic test for coronavirus, the employee will be given a coloured wrist band to confirm that their blood screen is clear and they can board the flight.

Anyone requiring further testing will not be allowed to depart and will be forwarded on to an approved coronavirus clinic to take a diagnostic test.

Rio Tinto Iron Ore chief executive Chris Salisbury said the company’s top priority was protecting its employees’ health as well as the communities where it operated, which was why the company had expanded the screening to include its important regional hubs.

“Since the introduction at Perth Airport last month, rapid screening has proven to be an effective tool enabling quick identification of people who may be at increased risk of having a viral illness prior to getting on a plane and arriving at a site in the Pilbara,” Salisbury said.

“The broader roll-out of our layered screening process to other regional airports such as Geraldton and Albany will allow us to continue operating safely and importantly, making a strong contribution to Western Australian communities.”

More than 8000 Rio Tinto’s FIFO employees and contractors have been through the screening process in the past month.

The introduction of screening processes at Busselton, Geraldton and Albany are also expected to create around 100 jobs, including nurses who may be out of work due to elective surgery restrictions during the pandemic.",https://www.australianmining.com.au/news/rio-tinto-expands-coronavirus-screening-to-regional-wa-airports/,,,

The Walking Dead fans were left scratching their heads over whether they had seen Dania Gurira’s character Michonne bow out from the show for good, or whether her sword-wielding character could resurface in season 10.

But now all has been revealed because TV bosses have teased Michonne’s return in the second half of season 10 as she and Virgil (Kevin Carroll) search for weapons on an island naval base.

With these weapons, the survivors will be able to end their war against the Whisperers and their walker herd, although we still are none the wiser about how many more episodes Gurira will appear before her planned departure.

Speaking about her exit, Gurira began: ‘It was overwhelming.

‘I mean, I haven’t talked about it yet because we haven’t really said I was done yet, so it was kinda just talking about it for the first time now but it was really overwhelming the love. They got me because I thought I was going home,’ she told ComicBook.com.

But when will she leave? (Picture: AMC)

Kevin has hinted at a juicy storyline (Picture: Gene Page/AMC)

Speaking to TV Insider, Kevin hinted that Virgil might not be all he seems, leading to an exciting storyline.

He explained: ‘I just want to tell [fans] that in this world of The Walking Dead, anything is possible.

‘At this point, I’m just excited for Virgil to get on the map, and start to mix it up in this world.

‘I am anxiously hoping that the fans can appreciate what this journey is about to be.

‘For people who love Michonne, this will be a rewarding piece of the journey for her. I think they’re going to have a good time with the twists and turns of this story.’

The actor also teased that ‘every facet of humanity is up for grabs because of everybody’s need to survive.’ So there’s a chance we could see Virgil turn…

But Kevin was keeping schtum on that, adding: ‘I’m going to leave it at that, and tell them to have a great time figuring it out.’

The Walking Dead season 10 will return to AMC on 23 February.

Observamos los datos de búsqueda de todo el Wiki de Disney, desde las mejores princesas hasta los nostálgicos espectáculos de Disney, canciones, villanos y más. En el estilo característico de Walt, los resultados contienen algunos familiares reconfortantes, con algunas sorpresas dispersas. Aquí hay algunos hallazgos que brillaron como la segunda estrella a la derecha:

Hay más en Disney que princesas

Cuando muchas personas piensan en Disney, la formación icónica de princesas podría ser lo primero que se les viene a la mente. No es sorprendente, considerando que la primera película de Walt Disney fue Blancanieves, la historia de una princesa arquetípica. Sin embargo, por importantes que sean las princesas, nuestros fanáticos europeos demuestran que Disney ha evolucionado para crecer en muchas direcciones desde sus raíces de cuento de hadas.

De hecho, solo 23 de los 50 países en nuestro estudio tenían una princesa claramente buscada, con muchos lugares europeos que favorecían a otros tipos de personajes, ya sean animales, criaturas mágicas o algo / alguien más, pero más sobre eso más adelante. En cuanto a los países que sí identificaron a una princesa superior, Ariel casi nadó a la cabeza, con grandes fans repartidos por Armenia, Irlanda y Rusia.

Cuando Disney + se lance esta semana, podemos esperar que los británicos se sintonicen con Enredados para ponerse al día con Rapunzel, mientras que en España y Alemania estarán maravillados con los poderes de Elsa, y en Francia quieren conocer más sobre Esmeralda.

Un buen momento de patos

Desde princesas hasta aves de corral, pronto ingresamos a algunos datos de búsqueda interesantes durante nuestro estudio europeo que merece la mejor facturación. Lo tienes: el continente está muy interesado en sus patos.

La mayor parte de esta obsesión con nuestros amigos emplumados se remonta al icónico programa animado de Disney Patoaventuras, que tuvo su primera presentación a fines de los años 40 con las comics de Carl Banks, y que alcanzó su pico de popularidad a finales de los años 80. La página del programa es la más buscada en la República Checa y Moldavia, mientras que Hungría tiene una sana fascinación con los Golfos Apandadores, la banda criminal de antagonistas de la serie, y el villano favorito de la República Checa es la poderosa y siniestra Mágica de Hechizo.

Los fanáticos finlandeses claramente han estado disfrutando de la versión actualizada de la serie, con Della Duck incluso convirtiéndose en su princesa favorita de Disney. Della fue presentada en la serie 2017, como la hermana y la madre de Donald del infame trío Juanito, Jorgito y Jaimito.

¿Pero por qué Patoaventuras? El atractivo profundo en toda Europa proviene de mucho antes de que la serie animada de los 80 llegara a nuestras pantallas. Los cómics de Disney, encabezados por Mickey Mouse y el Pato Donald, siempre han sido mucho más populares en Europa que en gran parte del resto del mundo. Desde la década de 1930, los cómics en Alemania, Francia, Italia y más, han estado contando historias en el universo del Pato Donald, sirviendo de inspiración y apoyo para los escenarios, personajes e historias de Patoaventuras. Esto ha hecho que los fanáticos europeos inviertan particularmente en la franquicia.También se debe en parte a la nueva reinvención del programa en los últimos años y, por supuesto, a esta canción.

Con una sonrisa y una canción

Hablando de temas, no puedes explorar el fandom de Disney sin encontrar una o dos canciones. El estudio tiene una gran cantidad de momentos musicales icónicos, que se reflejaron en búsquedas de páginas populares en toda Europa.

El Reino Unido está particularmente hipnotizado por las melodías, en particular por la famosa y envidiable voz de Ariel. “Parte de él” de La Sirenita y ‘The Love We Share’ de La Princesa Sofía son cantadas por la sirena, y son éxitos particulares para los británicos. “Cuando me Quería” de Toy Story 2 también es una búsqueda popular, supuestamente para cuando nuestros fans del Reino Unido quieran tomarse un momento emotivo.

“Es la noche del amor” es una de las páginas más buscadas de Croacia, quizás en parte debido a la regrabación de Beyoncé y Donald Glover para la versión de acción en vivo que la trae de vuelta a la luz del sol. Mientras tanto, Ucrania está cantando “You Have Got A Friend in Me”, Georgia está haciendo “Amigos del más allá” y Eslovenia está montando las olas de Hawaianas con la canción de Lilo & Stitch “He Mele No Lilo”. Cuando se trata de Disney, la música trasciende los océanos.

Reinos mágicos

¿Qué es una película de Disney, un programa de televisión, un juego o, francamente, cualquier cosa de Disney sin un poco de polvo de hadas? La magia aparece en todas las formas y en el historial de búsqueda de Europa, y aquí hay algunas chispas particulares que encontramos.

Muchos de los personajes más buscados en los países europeos tienen la capacidad de realizar magia. Mientras que Alemania e Italia favorecen a Elsa, España es parcial a la traviesa hada Campanilla. Mientras tanto, al igual que Flynn Rider, los Países Bajos y el Reino Unido están muy interesados ​​en el cabello de Rapunzel y las cualidades mágicas que posee (“¿cuánto tiempo lleva haciendo eso exactamente?”). Estos personajes son particularmente fascinantes, ya que tienen el potencial de sorprendernos, y a ellos mismos, con sus propias habilidades místicas.

Las criaturas mágicas y míticas también tienen su lugar en todo el continente. Las sirenas aparecen muchas veces en las búsquedas, particularmente populares en Suiza, con los personajes de La Sirenita siendo buscados en Armenia, Rusia, el Reino Unido e Irlanda. Macedonia del Norte tiene una inclinación por las brujas, mientras que Irlanda apoya a los trolls. No, no los matones de Internet: los sabios curanderos y emparejadores de Frozen. Su líder, Gran Pabbie, incluso tiene el honor de ser la página más buscada de Irlanda. Descrito como tan viejo como la Tierra, los irlandeses saben cómo valorar a sus mayores.

Caminando en el lado salvaje

Además de los reinos mágicos y las hadas, otro tema común que Disney recurre una y otra vez es el mundo animal. Desde mascotas hasta depredadores, hemos visitado selvas, desiertos y hogares familiares para pasar tiempo con criaturas de cuatro patas en todo el mundo. Estas son algunas de las principales búsquedas con temas de animales en toda Europa (aparte de los patos, por supuesto).

Los cachorros de lunares ocupan un lugar cálido y peludo en el corazón de Europa. La noche de las narices frías es la mejor película en Bélgica, Portugal e Italia, mientras que es la página más popular en Portugal, y Dylan (del nuevo programa de televisión Calle dálmatas) tiene una gran demanda en Rumania. Con un legado de casi 60 años, no es de extrañar que estos perros no vayan a ninguna parte.

Desde perros hasta gatos, El Rey León reina en toda Europa. La versión animada de 1994 es la película más popular en Serbia, Rumania y Kosovo, con otras películas en la franquicia, incluida la exitosa nueva versión de acción en vivo de 2019, que se llevó la corona en Noruega y Georgia. No es sorpresa, ya que El Rey León ha cerrado perfectamente la brecha entre dos generaciones. Su historia atemporal atrae a los millenials que crecieron con la versión animada, y a los niños que han descubierto la historia a través de la adaptación más reciente de Jon Favreau.

Las hienas problemáticas y sabias en cuanto al carácter Shenzei, Banzai y Ed mantienen un tribunal sobre Eslovenia y Suecia, la última de las cuales también está particularmente interesada en leones como Sarabi y Sarafina, mientras que Scar es el principal villano en Dinamarca y los Países Bajos. Sobre ese tema, es hora de estar preparados para nuestro hallazgo final …

Si bien los gustos de Disney pueden ser diferentes en todo el mundo, una cosa es segura: los fanáticos de Disney se pueden encontrar en todo el mundo.

The couple were diagnosed with COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, while visiting Australia, where Hanks was starting work on an Elvis Presley biopic.

""Hey, folks. Two weeks after our first symptoms and we feel better,"" Hanks wrote. ""Sheltering in place works like this: You don't give it to anyone - You don't get it from anyone. Common sense, no? Going to take awhile, but if we take care of each other, help where we can, and give up some comforts... this, too, shall pass. We can figure it out. Hanx.""

Hanks, 63, and Wilson, 63, were among the first celebrities to come forward with a positive coronavirus diagnosis. Hanks shared the news on March 11, confirming the two felt symptoms of COVID-19 before they were tested. The two were then quarantined at a Queensland hospital for five days. They have since been quarantined at their Australian home.

""Hello, folks. [Wilson] and I are down here in Australia,"" Hanks wrote on March 11. ""We felt a bit tired, like we had colds, and some body aches. Rita had some chills that came and went. Slight fevers too. To play things right, as is needed in the world right now, we were tested for the Coronavirus, and were found to be positive.""

Since then, Hanks and Wilson provided several updates while being isolated. Hanks most recent update came on March 17, when he said the only bad news for him was Wilson's superior Gin Rummy skills.

""One week after testing Positive, in self-isolation, the symptoms are much the same. No fever but the blahs,"" he wrote. ""Folding the laundry and doing the dishes leads to a nap on the couch.""

As for Wilson, her most recent post came on Sunday. She shared a clip of herself rapping Naughty by Nature's ""Hip Hop Hooray,"" and told fans she was being driven ""stir crazy"" by quarantine.

Since Hanks and Wilson went public with their diagnosis, several other celebrities have tested positive for COVID-19. Idris Elba, Andy Cohen, Olga Kurylenko, Daniel Dae Kim and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's wife, Sophie Gregoire Trudeau are just a few of the famous names tested for the illness.

There are more than 335,000 confirmed coronavirus cases in the world, according to John Hopkins University. On Sunday, the U.S. passed 33,000 cases and 400 deaths.

Portions of the incident were captured on video by videojournalist Robert Bumsted, who was working with photographer Maye-E Wong to document the protests in lower Manhattan over the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis.

The video shows more than a half-dozen officers confronting the journalists as they filmed and took photographs of police ordering protesters to leave the area near Fulton and Broadway shortly after an 8 p.m. curfew took effect.

An officer, using an expletive, orders them to go home. Bumsted is heard on video explaining the press are considered “essential workers” and are allowed to be on the streets. An officer responds “I don’t give a s— -.” Another tells Bumsted “get the f— — out of here you piece of s— -.”

Bumsted and Wong said officers shoved them, separating them from each other and pushing them toward Bumsted’s car, which was parked nearby. At one point Bumsted said he was pinned against his car. He is heard on video telling the officer that Wong has his keys and he needs them to leave the area. Officers then allowed Wong to approach and the two got in the vehicle and left.

Opinion This section contains relevant reference points, placed in (Opinion field)

Both journalists were wearing AP identification and identified themselves as media.

“They didn’t care,” Wong said. “They were just shoving me.”

NYPD officials said they would “review this as soon as possible.”

Journalists have faced aggressive police and protesters during demonstrations across the US over the killing of Floyd, a handcuffed black man who died after a white officer pressed his knee on Floyd’s neck.

Police in Louisville, Kentucky, apologized after an officer fired what appeared to be pepper bullets at a TV news crew, and a journalist in Minneapolis was shot by a rubber bullet.

Journalists have faced other risks while covering the unrest, in addition to dealing with aggression from police. In South Carolina, a television news reporter was hit in the head by a thrown rock and outside the White House, a Fox News reporter was chased and pummeled by protesters. Someone grabbed the reporter’s microphone and threw it at his back, and a Fox News photographer’s camera was smashed.

In Atlanta, demonstrators who fought with police and set cars on fire also broke windows and scrawled obscene graffiti at CNN headquarters.

AP spokeswoman Lauren Easton criticized the officers’ actions Tuesday, which occurred as thousands of people in New York were defying a curfew put in place following several nights of violence and destruction. Journalists covering the story are exempt from the curfew.

“The role of journalists is to report the news on behalf of the public,” Easton said. “It is unacceptable and deeply troubling when journalists are harassed simply for doing their job.”",https://www.arabnews.com/node/1684171/media,,,"['The Place', ""Who's Who""]"

EastEnders star Jake Wood has laughed off comments which claim he's the 'spitting image' of Love Island newbie, Ollie Williams.

Earlier this week, TV fans couldn’t help but notice the Max Branning actor’s resemblance to the posh islander Ollie.

Finally acknowledging the similarities, Jake shared a hilarious Instagram post which included a meme which has been circulating on Twitter .

In the image, the Love Island promotional shot of topless Ollie is twinned with a picture of Jake dressed as the womanizing businessman Max in Albert Square.

""Good to see Max from EastEnders going into the villa! #LoveIsland"".

And 47-year-old Jake cheekily added: ""FYI I’m the one on the right who doesn’t own a beach in Cornwall"" with two laughing faces.

This comes after the 23-year-old revealed that he could face losing his £15 million inheritance if he has sex on the ITV2 dating series.

The Love Island contestant is heir to the Lanhydrock Estate in Cornwall, and is set to take over his father's title of Lord of the Manor of Lanhydrock.

Before entering the villa, he admitted his dad Andrew would be furious if he ever got frisky on-screen.

He told The Sun : ""Initially, Dad said he would write me out of the will,” admitted Ollie.

""He was jesting, of course. But as the process got more and more serious Dad is saying, ‘if you get through, I hope you take me to South Africa with you’. He is now on board.""

Ollie, who has never watched Love Island, admitted his mother is more of a fan.

""Mum is huge addict of the show,"" he said. ""Dad has been forced to watch the odd episode.""

Ollie said of the estate: ""The house and the gardens are bequeathed to the National Trust. We live behind the house as a family. In the 1950s, it became very difficult to run a historic house fully staffed. And that’s the only real way to keep it alive.

""So it’s preserved as it was when we left it and we can still use it for functions and family parties. Our family home is not small. It’s called The Old Vicarage. It does the job. We don’t have any staff – apart from your regular cleaner.""

Ollie, who claimed he is a changed man after cheating on his previous girlfriend of four years several times, applied for the show after growing tired with life and work on the estate.

He admitted he keeps his vast fortune quiet when he starts dating a girl.

""In the past, girls have never known about my money – until I have taken them home,"" he said. ""I’m not a snob. And I don’t brag. I’m very humble and understated.

However, when Barve was asked about it, he said the firm offered its services free of cost and there was no question of any financial gains to it.

The project of police records' digitisation was awarded to CrispQ Information Technologies Pvt Ltd for five years by the previous Devendra Fadnavis-led government before the state Assembly polls were held in October last year, the sources said.

The company is owned by Barve's son Sumukh Barve and wife Sharmila Barve.

The firm sent a proposal on September 30, 2019 to the state government, offering its service ""pro bono"" (work undertaken voluntarily and without payment) to provide paperless office system to the Mumbai Police through a software called 'Notesheet Plus', an official said.

A copy of the proposal was marked to the Chief Minister's Office (CMO), he said.

Records, complaints and service documents of the Mumbai Police personnel were to be digitised with the help of the specified software, the official said.

The proposal was approved by the government as the company was going to do the work for free, and the Mumbai Police Commissioner's office was also directed to finalise the number of units and files for the digitisation work, the official said.

However, the project did not start due to some technical issues, he added.

When contacted, Barve said, ""The company had offered its service 'pro bono' and it was for the benefit of the Mumbai Police.""



The software, which was offered to be used by the company, is free and there is no question of any financial gains to the firm, he said.

Barve is retiring from service on February 29.

Allerdings habe das Gesundheitsministerium kritisiert, der Mossad habe nicht die ebenfalls notwendigen Stäbchen für den Abstrich mitgebracht.

Das Büro von Ministerpräsident Benjamin Netanjahu teilte lediglich mit, Israel setze in der Coronakrise alle Fähigkeiten des Staates ein, daran sei auch der Mossad beteiligt. ""Die Ausrüstung, die gekommen ist, ist notwendig und essenziell.""

Zuletzt hatte es immer wieder Kritik an der Regierung gegeben, Israel teste schlicht zu wenig Menschen auf das Virus Sars-CoV-2. Nach Angaben des israelischen Gesundheitsministeriums ist das Virus mittlerweile bei mehr als 500 Personen nachgewiesen worden. Todesfälle wurden bisher nicht erfasst.

Photo: HM Treasury

Self-employed people working across theatre and the creative industries will be able to apply for 80% of their average monthly profit up to £2,500, the government has announced.

The self-employed income support scheme was announced in a press briefing today (March 26) by chancellor of the exchequer Rishi Sunak, as part of emergency measures to support those losing income due to the Covid-19 pandemic.

It follows widespread calls from organisations including BECTU, Equity, the Creative Industries Federation and Stage Directors UK for greater government support for freelances, with warnings that many would face bankruptcy without help.

The government scheme will see self-employed people who have been adversely affected by the coronavirus paid a grant worth 80% of their average monthly profit over the last three years, up to 2,500 a month.

It is open to anyone across the UK with trading profits of up to £50,000 a year in 2018-19, or an average trading profit of less than £50,000 from 2016-17, 2017-18 and 2017-18.

The scheme will be available for at least three months and those who have access to the grants are still allowed to continue to do business.

Those who are recently self-employed and do not have accounts for 2018-19 will not receive any help under this scheme

Sunak said it would be unlikely that people would be able to access the scheme until June, and that in the meantime, self-employed people would have access to business interruption loans and the welfare system.

Those who are eligible will be contacted by HMRC and the grant will be paid directly into their bank accounts.

The Creative Industries Federation welcomed the measures as a “victory for the creative industries”, however warned there needs to be more immediately accessible support.

Chief executive Caroline Norbury said: “Although the measures announced today are welcome, it is vital that they are implemented as a matter of urgency, and certainly much quicker than the proposed timeline of June – two months later than those on payroll.

“Self-employed workers have outgoings and business expenses due immediately, which £94.25 a week in Universal Credit payments simply will not cover. They cannot wait three months to be paid.

“It is vital that government implements an interim basic income for the self-employed, until the scheme is fully operational.”

Head of Bectu Philippa Childs said: “Bectu has pushed incredibly hard for freelances and the self-employed to have parity with employees and the scale of the chancellor’s announcement clearly sets out to achieve that.

“However, we won’t stop and there are still many details to work through including how those who have paid themselves through dividends will fit into this scheme and also the time-scale.

“We know that the benefits system is under intense pressure with a five week wait for payments to be made and the self-employed and freelancers should have access to the coronavirus business interruption loans made available by the government.”

Equity general secretary Christine Payne welcomed the scheme, adding: “We look forward to offering our advice and assistance as the details of this scheme are worked out and hope that it can be brought online quicker than is anticipated.

“Our priority going forward will be to ensure that as many members as possible can access the scheme, including those whose profits have been reduced by the legitimate expenses incurred in the course of their work.”

The Incorporated Society of Musicians also welcomed the measures, and said it will be “looking closely at the package and advising [its] members and the wider music sector in due course.”",https://web.archive.org/web/20200404002703id_/https://www.thestage.co.uk/news/2020/coronavirus-self-employed-to-be-paid-80-of-average-monthly-profit-by-government/?login_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thestage.co.uk%2Faccounts%2Fusers%2Fsign_up.popup,,,"['Edinburgh', 'coronavirus']"

New infection in children is expected to go up by 104 per cent.

Since 2010, HIV infection among children in Sub-Saharan Africa has declined by 43 per cent, from 250,000 in 2010 to 140,000 in 2018.

A new projection by a group of five teams convened by the World Health Organization and UNAIDS shows an urgent need to strategise to mitigate and overcome interruptions in health services during the Covid-19 crisis.

A six-month disruption of antiretroviral therapy could lead to at least 500,000 more deaths from Aids-related illnesses in sub-Saharan Africa between 2020 and 2021.

This would mean setting the clock on HIV-related deaths back to where they were in 2008. During the year, more than 950,000 Aids-related deaths were recorded in the sub-Saharan region.

According to WHO, an estimated 470,000 people died of Aids-related illnesses in the region in 2018.

People living with HIV are likely to get seriously sick if they contract the coronavirus when their immune system is compromised.

The projection estimates that failure to take urgent action could lead to more deaths for another five years.

“The terrible prospect of half a million more people in Africa dying of Aids-related illnesses is like stepping back into history,” WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.

“We must read this as a wake-up call to countries to identify ways to sustain all vital health services.”

The WHO boss commended countries already taking steps such as ensuring that people can collect bulk packs of treatment and other essential commodities, including self-testing kits from drop-off points.

“This relieves pressure on health services and the health workforce. We must also ensure that global supplies of tests and treatment continue to flow to the countries that need them,” Ghebreyesus said.

Kenya is among the countries that have allowed people living with HIV to get bulk stocks of ARVs that last them three months.

Health facilities in Nairobi have already implemented the directive, and some are dispensing drugs that can last up to six months.

Previously, only a few individuals with stable immunity were allowed to pick up enough drugs to last more than one month.

""To reduce clinic attendance and drug pickup frequencies, up to three-month multi-month dispensing of ARVs should be considered for all people living with HIV regardless of age and viral status,"" Nascop head Dr Catherine Ngugi said in a circular to all county executives for health.

It is estimated that in 2018, 25.7 million people were living with HIV and 16.4 million (around 64 per cent) in sub-Saharan Africa were undergoing antiretroviral therapy.

But according to the WHO, they are now at risk of having their treatment interrupted either because of the closure of HIV services, lack of ARVs caused by disruptions in the supply chain or overwhelmed services due to competing needs to support the Covid-19 response.

The research teams used different mathematical models to analyse the effects of possible disruptions to HIV testing, prevention and treatment services caused by Covid-19 in three or six months on Aids mortality and HIV incidence in Sub-Saharan Africa.

From the projection, a six-month disruption shows that Aids-related deaths in one year will range from 471,000 to 673,000.

This means that it will be inevitable for the world to miss the global 2020 target of fewer than 500,000 Aids-related deaths worldwide.

More sporadic interruptions of ART supply could lead to drug resistance, with long-term consequences for future treatment success in the region.

UNAIDS executive director Winnie Byanyima has warned against using Covid-19 as an excuse to divert investments meant to go towards HIV programmes.

“There is a risk that the hard-earned gains of the AIDS response will be sacrificed to the fight against Covid-19, but the right to health means that no one disease should be fought at the expense of the other,” Byanyima said.

“Every death is a tragedy. We cannot sit and allow hundreds of thousands of people, many of them young, to die needless deaths.”",https://www.the-star.co.ke/news/2020-05-13-covid-19-interruptions-may-increase-mother-to-child-hiv-infections/,,,

He Lives In Berkeley', 'Roasts His Own Coffee', 'Drinks Craft Beer.']",Games of the Decade 2010 to 2019: A personal list of favorites,en,,,,"Although titles such as ""Minecraft"" and ""Fortnite"" were more impactful, video games such as ""Pokemon Go"" and ""Hearthstone"" had more staying power fo me.","Picking the best games of the decade is an increasingly tough task. The number of titles keeps expanding while the number of platforms has blossomed beyond consoles and PCs. Players encounter so much content that the job of winnowing all that down to a top-10 list is daunting.

I haven’t played all the critically acclaimed titles. Games such as “Undertale” have escaped my purview, but I’ve played plenty of releases over the past 10 years. The list below isn’t based on quality per se, but it’s more personal. These are the games that had a lasting impact on me. They are the ones that I fondly remember or the titles that I still play today.

That’s partly why titles such as “Minecraft” and “Fortnite” aren’t on that list. Although those are the two most important releases of the decade, they aren’t ones that I played very much. With that said, here are the games that were the most important to me over the past decade.

1 “Pokemon Go” — This unconventional take on the popular franchise had a surreal level of popularity when it was released during the summer of 2016. That enthusiasm has died down but the game remains a force.

Of all the games I played this decade, this has had the biggest impact on my life. That’s because of the nature of Niantic’s location-based game. It’s a title that’s played outside in the real world and encourages players to explore their neighborhood to find pocket monsters.

That pushes players to interact face to face and opens up opportunities to foster bonds between players. The magic of “Pokemon Go” is how it manages to build community. It’s a game that has led to real-life friendships and even a commitment to running. It’s a mobile title that has enriched the lives of players because its a game that exists beyond the screen.

2 “Hearthstone” — I tried and failed to get into “Magic: The Gathering” as a teenager but I gave the collectible card game genre another chance with “Hearthstone.” I wasn’t disappointed. Part of the success of Blizzard’s game is that the developers simplified the gameplay elements and put it on mobile platforms and tablets.

It opened up the game to a huge audience and the accessible gameplay made it easy to pick up. The combination of the two has made it hugely successful and turned “Hearthstone” into a popular esport. The only black mark on its resume is the controversy over a Hong Kong protest this year.

3 “Dark Souls 2” — Those who love the Hidetaka Miyazaki’s “Souls” game have a moment when his games just click for them. They look beyond the difficulty and appreciate the lessons contained within the adventure. No other title this decade taught me more about patience, persistence and perseverance than “Dark Souls 2.”

This isn’t the best game of the series, but it is the one that hooked me on to this style of gaming. Every encounter is fraught with danger and players feel the tension in every fight. Yes, the game is difficult and it can be obtuse at times, but it’s also the most rewarding experience I’ve had this decade.

4. “The Last of Us” — One of the most overlooked aspects of modern gaming has been the performances of voice actors. That has changed thanks in part thanks to the work of Naughty Dog, and the performances by actors Troy Baker and Ashley Johnson in this post-apocalyptic masterpiece.

The visuals are gorgeous for its time and the gameplay mechanics are solid with a mix action and stealth, but it’s the world that Naughty Dog creates and the actors’ performances that invest players in the characters and transformed how we appreciate games.

5. “Red Dead Redemption” — This game kicked off the decade and set the bar for the open-world genre. The beautiful visuals coupled with an intriguing story and memorable protagonist in John Marston made this a game that fans enjoyed living with.

It’s an adventure that used its environment to its advantage, creating a distinct take on the wild west. One that few games have been able to match.

6. “Mass Effect 3” — This title capped off arguably the best video game trilogy in years. It was also the culmination of years of storytelling as BioWare wrapped up a journey that began in 2007. What’s notable about this project is how the choices players made over each chapter impacted the totality of the finale.

The ending itself was not without controversy and showed how games aren’t just one-way streets from developers to players. It is a collaboration in which those who make the games must listen to their audience.

7. “The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild” — Nintendo’s first foray into an open-world “Zelda” was hugely successful and helped with the strong launch of the Nintendo Switch. “Breath of the Wild” was also the biggest departure from the series tried and true formula, but somehow it maintained the ethos of discovery and adventure. It was a series that needed a heavy dose of change and Eiji Aonuma and his team delivered.

8. “Monster Hunter World” — The disparity between the popularity of the “Monster Hunter” franchise in Japan and the U.S. has always been wide, but it has significantly narrowed thanks to this entry in the series. Not only has Capcom produced one of its most visually striking games, but by streamlining the mechanics it made it more approachable and addictive. All of this creates one of the best entries and one that broke out in the United States in a big way.

9. “Sid Meier’s Civilization V: Brave New World” — Every once in a while I have the urge to play a campaign of “Civilization.” Few franchises have had its hooks in me like that. The developer, Firaxis, has molded a successful franchise by launching a new chapter with improved visuals and mechanics, but over time, they have refined it through downloadable expansion packs. The process has made a great game perfect. The pinnacle of the series is “Brave New World,” where the team brings in ideas such as the World Congress, tourism and Great Works to add a new layer of depth to the late game. This game continues to be one I return to despite a solid sequel.

10. “Overwatch” — The rise of esports has been one of the major stories of the decade, and one of the games that capitalized on that is “Overwatch.” Blizzard’s team-based shooter was a hit because it allowed players of all skill levels to compete by allowing them to fulfill different roles. If someone doesn’t great quick-twitch skills or accuracy, they may have a talent at tactics or healing. That makes it more accessible and rewarding. I’ve spent hours playing with my brother and cousins and figuring out our own playstyles.

Blizzard has done a great job at cultivating “Overwatch” as an esport, and with its Overwatch League moving its teams to local markets in 2020 and a sequel on the way, the future looks bright for the game.",https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/12/31/games-of-the-decade-2010-to-2019-a-personal-list-of-favorites/,,,['Video Games']

Kobe Bryant's wife Vanessa has paid a touching tribute to the icon and their daughter Gianna two months after their tragic deaths.

Vanessa took to her Instagram account on Thursday to share a heartbreaking video of Kobe talking about coaching Gianna.

Gianna, and Kobe lost their lives in a helicopter crash in January, exactly two months before Vanessa posted the tribute.

The 13-year-old was an aspiring basketball player and Kobe, who played for the Lakers, coached her Amateur Athletic Union team.

In the video shared by Vanessa, Kobe said: ""She started out playing soccer, which is one of my favorite sports as well.

""But then, when she asked about learning the game of basketball, I started teaching her piece by piece, and she started enjoying it and loving it and now she plays every day.

""It's been a joy to watch her grow and to be there every day for that process.

""Her temperament is a lot like mine. She’s extremely competitive, very fiery, and backs down from no challenge.""

In the clip Kobe says Gianna is ""a good mix of me and good mix of her mama, so that makes her even more competitive than I am.""

Vanessa captioned the post with two broken heart emojis.

It comes after she spoke at Kobe and Gianna's memorial last month.

Speaking about Kobe, Vanessa said: ""He was mine. He was my everything. Kobe and I had been together since I was 17 years old.

""I was his first girlfriend, his first love, his wife, his best friend, his confidante and his protector. He was the most amazing husband. Kobe loved me more than I could ever express or put into words.""

Vanessa also paid honour to Gianna and revealed what she has been missing.

She said: ""I miss her sweet kisses, her cleverness, her sarcasm, her wit and that adorable sly side smile followed with a grin and burst of laughter.

""Gigi was sunshine. She brightened up my day every day. I miss looking at her beautiful face. She was always so good, a rule follower.

Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa said, “The lockdown has brought miseries for many sections of the people. To overcome this situation, a compensation has been announced today.”

Flower growers and vegetable farmers

Flower growers have faced many difficulties after their crops had been destroyed following the lack of demand for their produce due to lockdown. It is said farmers had cultivated flowers in about 11,687 hectares of land. “Realising flower growers problems, government has decided upon a compensation of Rs 25,000 per hectare limited to the maximum extent of one hectare for the flower growers who have suffered crop loss,” said Yediyurappa.

Farmers who have grown vegetables and fruits were also not able to market their produce. Hence, the government has announced a relief package to this section as well.

Yediyurappa said, “Covid-19 not only affected farmers, but also affected the service professionals such as barbers and washermen (Dhobis) both in urban and rural areas. For this section government has decided to provide one time compensation of Rs 5,000 each to benefit about 60,000 washermen (Dhobis) and about 2.30 lakh barbers.”

Auto rickshaw and taxi drivers too have lost their incomes due to the lockdown. “It is decided to help about 7.75 lakh auto and taxi drivers by providing one-time compensation of Rs 5,000 each,” announced Yediyurappa.

Construction workers

Certain steps have already been initiated to transfer Rs 2,000 to the accounts of the remaining four lakh construction workers soon after verifying the beneficiaries’ bank account details. In addition to this, the government has decided to transfer additional amount of Rs 3,000 to building workers through DBT.

MSMEs

“The monthly fixed charges of electricity bills of MSMEs will be waived for two months. Payment of fixed charges in the electricity bills of the large industries will be deferred without penalty and interest for a period of two months,” Yediyurappa said.

The following benefits will be provided for electricity consumers of all categories: Incentive and concessions will be given to the consumer who pays the bills in stipulated time. There will be a reduction in the interest rates on the amount for the delayed payment. Incentive will be provided to the consumers who pays the bills in advance.

“The opportunity will be provided for the payment of balance bill amount in instalments. Electricity connection will not be disconnected till June 30, 2020 for the consumers, who have not paid the balance amount of electricity bill,” said Yediyurappa.

Weavers

The State government has already announced “Weavers Loan Waiver” scheme worth Rs 109 crore. “Of which, Rs 29 crore had been released during 2019-20. Balance amount of Rs 80 crore will be released immediately. This will help weavers to get fresh loans to continue their occupation. The reimbursement benefit will be provided for the weavers who have repaid their loan amount between January 1, 2019 to March 31, 2019,” said the Chief Minister.

He further said, “I am pleased to announce a new scheme Nekarara Sammana Yojane for the benefit of the suffering weavers. Under this scheme government will deposit Rs 2,000 directly to the bank account of the hand-loom weaver through DBT. This will benefit about 54,000 hand-loom weavers in the state.”

3714,1600371047,['Tracey Ross'],Congress Must Act Now to Protect the Most Vulnerable from the Coronavirus,en,,,,,"

As our communities deal with the spread of the coronavirus, federal leaders must take bold steps to ensure the safety of the public, particularly the most vulnerable among us. While this virus will hit communities regardless of race, income, or zip code, this pandemic will cause both health and economic disruptions that exacerbate the existing disparities for low-income people and communities of color that have long harmed our nation.

CALL YOUR SENATOR



Please call your senators and ask them to pass the emergency House bill to help us navigate this public health and economic crisis.

Early Saturday morning, the House passed an emergency bill that would allocate billions of dollars for paid sick leave, unemployment insurance, free testing, and other measures to help those impacted by this crisis. This is a necessary starting point that the Senate must pass now.

Unfortunately, these measures are narrow in scope, leaving 80 percent of workers unprotected. While some large employers are doing the right thing and giving employees sick leave, a national policy is the most effective measure in this time of unprecedented national crisis. We need comprehensive legislation to follow this initial bill to protect all people, especially those with the greatest health and economic risks.

We Need Comprehensive Public Health and Economic Supports



Today, 100 million people — one in three people in the US — live in or on the brink of poverty where an illness, job loss, or unexpected expense can be financially insurmountable. At a time when officials are urging the public to stay home when they fall ill, millions of people lack paid sick leave and can’t afford to miss work to care for themselves or a loved one. This puts many people at risk for being the vector of an illness that can prove deadly for the elderly and immunocompromised. And as businesses take precautions or are forced through social-distancing norms to close, the resulting loss of income for workers and owners will cause increased numbers of people to fall behind on bills and risk their housing, health, utility, and food security.

We must plan and act with the most vulnerable in mind to both stop the spread of this virus, and ensure that weeks and months of addressing this public health crisis don’t turn into years of economic hardship.

Specifically, we are calling on federal leaders to champion the following policies:

Pass a Paid Leave Policy for All Workers – Low-wage workers who cannot afford to lose a day's wages because of illness are less likely to seek medical care (for themselves and for their families) than workers who do have paid sick leave, and are 1.5 times more likely to go to work with contagious illnesses. This means that lack of paid sick leave is not only a problem for individual workers, but also a public health threat. Building on the House-passed version, a paid sick leave policy that covers all workers is urgently needed to address the new coronavirus outbreak and beyond to help protect the health and safety of the population.

Ensure Emergency Income During Work Disruptions – We need to provide guaranteed income to help those facing disruptions to their income due to lost opportunities, funding streams, or customers. This includes small business owners and their employees, community-serving nonprofits, freelancers and artists, and workers in a gig economy who are not eligible for unemployment benefits but still must make their rent or mortgage payments.

Place a Moratorium on All Evictions and Foreclosures and Ensure Housing Stability – We are in the midst of a housing crisis – We are in the midst of a housing crisis where 21 million renters and 17 million homeowners pay more than a third of their income on housing bills, making them extremely vulnerable to income disruptions. We need a moratorium on all evictions and foreclosures to prevent the economic fallout of the virus. We must also provide emergency housing vouchers for all unhoused people, and those facing eviction. And at a minimum, we need to stop displacing homeless encampments, and take measures to increase access to water, hand-washing stations, and sanitation at current encampments to support critical health outcomes.

Prevent Utility Shut-Offs and Restore Water Service to All Households – Loss of income for households, workers, and small businesses will cause increased numbers of people to fall behind on bills and face utility services shut-offs. – Loss of income for households, workers, and small businesses will cause increased numbers of people to fall behind on bills and face utility services shut-offs. Over a third of US households are already at risk of inability to pay rising water bills. This is particularly concerning as washing our hands is our first line of defense against the virus. All public and private utilities should halt any utility shut-offs during this crisis, restore service to households currently experiencing a shutoff, and provide water delivery to all households with contaminated water systems.

Ensure Hospitals and Health-Care Centers Are Safe Places for Immigrants and Anyone Seeking Care – We must eliminate all barriers to people seeking proper medical attention, regardless of insurance or lack thereof. This also includes ensuring no one’s immigration status will be questioned when seeking assistance. Hospitals and health-care facilities must make it clear in all languages that immigration status will not be questioned, and should take steps to ensure immigration enforcement officials are not permitted in buildings.

Prevent the Spread of COVID-19 Through the Incarcerated Population – In the US, – In the US, 2.3 million people are exposed to overcrowded and unsanitary conditions in prisons and jails, which will contribute to the spread of the coronavirus as the incarcerated population interacts with staff and other visitors. At a minimum, we must ensure incarcerated people have access to medical care and personal hygiene products; release elderly people with underlying medical problems to parole supervision; and release those who have an anticipated release date in 2020 and 2021 to parole supervision.

We are heartened by the swift actions that leaders in cities across the country are taking, proving once again that local leaders are national leaders. But we need policymakers at all levels to urgently address the threat of this current pandemic while ensuring we protect all struggling communities beyond this crisis.

3718,1605422147,,"AIDS deaths in sub-Saharan Africa could double, U.N warns",en,,,,,"The United Nations (U.N) has said that the fight against AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa has stalled as more and more countries in the region shift their attention to controlling the spread of COVID-19.

The U.N says that countries in the region have diverted resources meant to fight AIDS in controlling the coronavirus pandemic.

As a result, AIDS virus-related illnesses could claim more than half a million people.

In a joint report, the World Health Organisation (WHO) and UNAIDS warned that interruptions to HIV/AIDS treatment could “set the clock back by more than a decade to 2008 when more than 950,000 AIDS deaths were observed in the region”.

In 2018, an estimated 470,000 people died from AIDS-related illnesses in sub-Saharan Africa, the report says.

Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the Director-General of WHO says; “The terrible prospect of half a million more people in Africa dying of Aids-related illnesses is like stepping back into history.”

We must read this as a wake-up call to countries to identify ways to sustain all vital health services, he added

Ghebreyesus says that there is need to ensure that global supplies of tests and treatments for both HIV and Tuberculosis reach the countries and communities that need them most.

“We should save people from Covid-19 and HIV and other life-threatening diseases.”

A six-month disruption in treatment services could lead to an excess of 471,000 to 673,000 AIDS-related deaths in one year, the report says, making it inevitable that the world would miss the global 2020 target of fewer than 500,000 fatalities from the disease worldwide.

According to WHO statistics, an estimated 25.7 million people in Sub- Saharan Africa were living with HIV in 2018, with 16.4 million (64 per cent) receiving antiretroviral therapy.

These people now risk having their treatment interrupted, the agencies warned, “because HIV services are closed or are unable to supply antiretroviral therapy because of disruptions to the supply chain, or because services simply become overwhelmed”.

The report also highlighted that disrupted services could reverse gains made in stemming mother-to-child transmission of HIV

Since 2010, new HIV infections among children in Sub-Saharan Africa have declined by 43 per cent (from 250,000 in 2010 to 140,000 in 2018), thanks to the high coverage of HIV services for mothers and their children in the region

Every death is a tragedy, the Executive Director of UNAIDS, Winnie Byanyima, observed.

“We cannot sit by and allow hundreds of thousands of people, many of them young, to die needless deaths.”

If HIV health services were stopped by COVID-19, the study indicates that several countries could see a drastic rise in new infections among children.

Byanyima says that the pandemic must not be an excuse to divert investment from HIV.

“There is a risk that the hard-earned gains of the Aids response will be sacrificed to the fight against Covid-19, but the right to health means that no one disease should be fought at the expense of the other.”

The War of the Realms ravaged Thor's homeland, but by the end of the event, Odin the All-Father stepped down and crowned Thor as the new King of Asgard. Now, months after the end of the war, Thor has rebuilt his home. Gone are the shimmering golden palaces of his father's creation, with the seat of the king remade in wood and stone. But now what was once a golden paradise, remade into a medieval city, shaped by hammers... has just been rocked by the arrival of Galactus in Marvel's shocking Thor #1.

As Thor readies himself to give his first speech to the Asgardians gathered around their new king -- a message readers can only assume would have reflected the same message sent by the remade land itself, Galactus comes plummeting down from the sky, smashing directly into city's inhabitants, and Thor instantly realizing that scores of his people will never get the chance to hear a speech ever again.

The sight of Galactus wrapped in machine armor, decimating the crowd is a horrifying one, to be sure. Screams are heard, as bolts of lightning mark Thor's leap into the fight, prepared to kill Galactus for this invasion of his people's new home. Thankfully Thor has the presence of mind to stop before then, stopping short as Galactus pleads with Thor to understand the reason for his arrival. He has come to Asgard for help, since Thor is the only one who can stop the Great Black Winter. The newest unknown threat to Thor (and all life in the universe), and one that can only be stopped if Thor becomes the newest herald of Galactus.

Right on cue the mourning rains of Asgard begin to fall, carrying on for weeks. The city officials of Asgard work, busying themselves with counting the dead and calculating the cost of Galactus's 'arrival.' And while they may try to ignore the silence of their new king, it is evident more than just Asgard's people died the day Galactus fell. Galactus' impact also means that Yggdrasil, the tree of life, has begun to die. How will thor possibly manage to correct these tragedies, and return to his brighter vision for Asgard's future? To have those questions answered, readers will need to pick up Thor #1! Find the full details below.

3826,1484699049,['Simply Wall St'],Here's Why We Think H.B. Fuller (NYSE:FUL) Is Well Worth Watching,en,,,,"It's only natural that many investors, especially those who are new to the game, prefer to buy shares in 'sexy' stocks...","It's only natural that many investors, especially those who are new to the game, prefer to buy shares in 'sexy' stocks with a good story, even if those businesses lose money. But as Warren Buffett has mused, 'If you've been playing poker for half an hour and you still don't know who the patsy is, you're the patsy.' When they buy such story stocks, investors are all too often the patsy.

So if you're like me, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like H.B. Fuller (NYSE:FUL). While that doesn't make the shares worth buying at any price, you can't deny that successful capitalism requires profit, eventually. In comparison, loss making companies act like a sponge for capital - but unlike such a sponge they do not always produce something when squeezed.

View our latest analysis for H.B. Fuller

H.B. Fuller's Earnings Per Share Are Growing.

If you believe that markets are even vaguely efficient, then over the long term you'd expect a company's share price to follow its earnings per share (EPS). That means EPS growth is considered a real positive by most successful long-term investors. H.B. Fuller managed to grow EPS by 7.7% per year, over three years. That might not be particularly high growth, but it does show that per-share earnings are moving steadily in the right direction.

Careful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. It seems H.B. Fuller is pretty stable, since revenue and EBIT margins are pretty flat year on year. That's not bad, but it doesn't point to ongoing future growth, either.

In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings, and revenue, over time. To see the actual numbers, click on the chart.

Of course the knack is to find stocks that have their best days in the future, not in the past. You could base your opinion on past performance, of course, but you may also want to check this interactive graph of professional analyst EPS forecasts for H.B. Fuller.

Are H.B. Fuller Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?

It makes me feel more secure owning shares in a company if insiders also own shares, thusly more closely aligning our interests. So it is good to see that H.B. Fuller insiders have a significant amount of capital invested in the stock. Indeed, they hold US$22m worth of its stock. That shows significant buy-in, and may indicate conviction in the business strategy. Even though that's only about 0.9% of the company, it's enough money to indicate alignment between the leaders of the business and ordinary shareholders.

Should You Add H.B. Fuller To Your Watchlist?

One positive for H.B. Fuller is that it is growing EPS. That's nice to see. Just as polish makes silverware pop, the high level of insider ownership enhances my enthusiasm for this growth. That combination appeals to me, for one. So yes, I do think the stock is worth keeping an eye on. Of course, identifying quality businesses is only half the battle; investors need to know whether the stock is undervalued. So you might want to consider this free discounted cashflow valuation of H.B. Fuller.

Although H.B. Fuller certainly looks good to me, I would like it more if insiders were buying up shares. If you like to see insider buying, too, then this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying, could be exactly what you're looking for.

A number of relatively arcane laws mean Senators are meant to stay quiet and are not allowed to speak to each other during proceedings.

Technically, the only drink allowed to be consumed on the floor of the chamber is water, but allowances have been made for milk, sending social media into overdrive as to why one senator was reportedly seen drinking milk during the trial.

Can anyone explain to me why senators during the impeachment are only allowed to drink water or milk? This may be one of the strangest things I've ever seen... — Doug Black Jr (@dougblackjr) January 22, 2020

But behind closed doors - where the media is not allowed - senators have been flouting the quaint guidelines of the chamber that typically prizes decorum.

Gum-chewing, snacking, yawning and alleged napping could be seen throughout the cramped chamber, the Associated Press reported.

Senators were especially restless Wednesday, local time, as lawmakers convened less than 12 hours after the marathon session that stretched to nearly 2 am.

A number of senators were seen resting their eyes, dozing and appearing to take brief naps, according to CNN and the Associated Press.

A cartoonist for the New York Times observing the proceedings even managed to sketch Republican senator James Risch dozing off.

Others, meanwhile, were seen passing notes and doing crosswords while senators were speaking.

Chief Justice John Roberts, who is presiding over the affair, admonished senators as tensions rose on Wednesday, local time, reminding those gathered it is the “world’s greatest deliberative body,” functioning, for now, as a court of impeachment.

Story continues

It has a tradition of civility — and for rare impeachment trials, specific rules: No coffee or snacking on the floor. No pacing, note-passing, working on other matters or chit-chat. It’s all designed to focus the senator-jurors on the issues at hand. So napping is not, in theory, part of the plan.

A number of senators also left the chamber during the opening days, some to conduct lengthy TV interviews, leaving a number of seats empty, AP reported.

‘Its not fantasy football’

In the opening two days of proceedings, the two sides have been wrangling over rules for the trial and who will be allowed to testify.

Republicans shot down, one by one, Democratic efforts to get Trump aides to testify, including former national security adviser John Bolton, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney.

Bolton has referred to the White House's alleged political pressure on Ukraine as a ""drug deal"", according to previous witness testimony in the House of Representatives.

Trump is charged with abusing his power by trying to pressure Ukraine to investigate political rival and leading Democratic presidential candidate, Joe Biden.

The Republican-controlled US Senate has voted on party lines to approve the rules for President Donald Trump's impeachment trial, rejecting Democratic efforts to obtain evidence and ensure witnesses are heard.

Trump’s Republican allies in the Senate say the son of Joe Biden, Hunter, should testify after Trump accused the former vice president of pursuing his son's interests by pressuring Ukraine to oust a prosecutor that had scrutinised a Ukrainian gas company. No evidence of wrongdoing by Biden has emerged.

Top Democrat Chuck Schumer hosed down the idea of a witness trade, telling reporters during a break in the trial “that trade is not on the table”.

“This isn't like some fantasy football trade,” he said. “Trials aren't trades for witnesses.”

Democrats will continue their arguments through Friday under rules approved by the Senate.

Trump's lawyers will then have up to three days to rebut the Democrats' case, likely starting from Saturday.

The lead Democratic prosecutor and California congressman Adam Schiff, urged Republicans to vote to remove Mr Trump from office to ""protect our democracy"".

""President Trump solicited foreign interference in our democratic elections, abusing the power of his office to seek help abroad to improve his re-election prospects at home,"" he said overnight.

Subhash Batham, an accused in a murder case who was out on bail, held at least 22 children hostage after inviting them to his house for a birthday party of his daughter in Kathariya village in Uttar Pradesh’s Farukkhabad.

One person was injured in his leg by a gunshot when some of the residents tried to open the door. Later, Batham had also hurled a crude bomb and fired gunshots on villagers and policemen rushed to rescue the children.

Some reports said Batham held the children hostages, who were aged between six months and 15 years, for being wrongly framed in a murder case and wanted to pressurise the authorities for dropping the criminal charges against him.

A local police officer told media that security personnel took the action with extreme caution in order to ensure the safety of the children locked inside the house.

After the overnight stand-off, a special team of trained policemen and commandos killed him in a shoot-out, while two officers were also wounded in the operation.

The hostages were rescued by the security team without any injury.

According to the reports, Batham’s wife was also killed on Thursday night, after villagers reportedly beat her to death and threw stones at her when she attempted to run away from the scene.

The fill-in role led to stints hosting five- and 15-minute segments on weekdays and weeknights and ultimately to her own long-running show, “The Lee Phillip Show” (the name was changed a handful of times), on which she explored social issues and interviewed prominent people like Presidents Gerald R. Ford and Ronald Reagan, Judy Garland, Clint Eastwood, Oprah Winfrey, Lucille Ball, the Beatles and the Rolling Stones.

Her documentary specials for WBBM covered topics like foster care, divorce and rape. One special, “The Rape of Paulette,” in which she interviewed rape victims and examined a criminal justice system that often failed to bring rapists to justice, won a local Emmy and a DuPont Award from Columbia University after it aired in 1973. Her work for WBBM won 16 regional Emmys.

She met William Bell while he was working as an account executive for an advertising agency in the same building as WBBM. They married in 1954, and Mr. Bell quit his advertising job to write for several soap operas, including the perennial “Days of Our Lives.”

Ms. Bell continued to host and produce daytime talk shows for WBBM, but with her husband she also developed “The Innocent Years!” for CBS in 1972, before changing the title to “The Young and the Restless,” feeling it better fit the mood of the 1970s.",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/28/arts/television/lee-phillip-bell-dead.html,,,
3917,1535476650,,"How To Get Rid Of Chest Acne, According To A Dermatologist",en,,,,"Because pores exist everywhere on our bodies, there also exists the possibility for breakouts everywhere on our bodies. (Great!) But some of those pores are more prone to acne than others, like those that are more exposed to sweat, bacteria, oil,…","Because pores exist everywhere on our bodies, there also exists the possibility for breakouts everywhere on our bodies. (Great!) But some of those pores are more prone to acne than others, like those that are more exposed to sweat, bacteria, oil, inflammation, and other pore-clogging, pimple-causing phenomena — and that includes your chest. I reached out to New York City-based dermatologists Dr. Robyn Gmyrek and Dr. Kenneth Howe to understand what causes chest acne in the first place, and how to get rid of chest acne should you want to treat these breakouts.

According to Dr. Gmyrek, chest acne is basically the same thing as facial acne. “When a pore gets clogged by dead skin cells at the opening, sebum gets trapped inside. That creates inflammation, which leads to pimples and an overgrowth of bacteria,” she explains. Also like facial acne, the causes for chest acne are often multi-pronged. Some people have a genetic predisposition to acne, while some might experience hormonal breakouts. But along with biological factors, Dr. Gmyrek says that chest acne can be caused or worsened by excessive sweating, especially while wearing tight-fitting clothing. Occlusive clothing, like sports bras and compression shirts, trap sweat and oil, which leads to more bacteria and inflammation. Et voila: chest acne.

Beyond showering ASAP after a workout, you can also use pimple-fighting products to keep chest acne at bay. But be mindful of the products you’re using to treat chest acne, as Dr. Gmyrek warns that “your chest skin is more sensitive to being dried out or irritated by medicated acne products than facial skin.” So if you’re using a concentrated spot treatment, use it sparingly and occasionally so you don’t exacerbate dryness.

Dr. Howe adds that the risk of scarring is greater with chest acne, “particularly deeper acne cysts on the central chest"" — so whatever you do, don’t pick at your spots. Dr. Howe says those resulting scabs and scars can take months to clear up. And if over-the-counter remedies aren’t working for you, Dr. Howe recommends paying a visit to your dermatologist. “Probably because the area is covered by clothes, a lot of patients neglect getting treatment for their chest,” he says. “But why continue to suffer, when we can clear it up?”

That said, there are ways to treat chest acne at home. Start with these five dermatologist-approved products, listed ahead, which can help you prevent, treat, and get rid of chest acne for good.

1. Try A Spray-On Exfoliant Paula’s Choice Clear Acne Body Spray $25 | Amazon See on Amazon This Paula’s Choice Clear Acne Body Spray contains 2% salicylic acid, a mainstay ingredient for treating acne. But in this formula, soothing and hydrating ingredients like allantoin, glycerin, and hyaluronic acid counteract salicylic acid's drying effects, which might otherwise be too intense for the thin skin on your chest. Dr. Gmyrek points out that this spray can be helpful for treating hard-to-reach back acne, too, since the pump is designed to spray at any angle. ""I love this stuff! This is the 3rd time I’ve repurchased it. I get bad breakouts on my shoulders and chest, and this spray clears them up within a few days and doesn’t dry out my skin,"" commented one satisfied customer.

2. Use An Acne-Fighting Body Wash In The Shower Proactiv Deep Cleansing Wash $38 | Amazon See on Amazon If you have mild to moderate chest acne, Dr. Howe recommends using an acne-fighting body wash since they’re so easy to incorporate into your daily routine. (That said, Dr. Howe says that more severe cases of body acne might not respond to foaming cleansers, since they simply aren't left on long enough to thoroughly penetrate skin.) Like the Paula’s Choice body spray, the Proactiv Deep Cleansing Wash contains 2% salicylic acid, which is the highest percentage of salicylic acid permitted in an over-the-counter product. The formula also contains soothing ingredients like aloe, jojoba esters, and camellia leaf extract to keep dryness and inflammation under control. Dr. Gmyrek suggests using this body wash with a gently exfoliating washcloth or body scrubber to maximize its pore-cleansing powers.

3. Always Apply Sunscreen EltaMD UV Sport Broad-Spectrum SPF 50 $24 | Amazon See on Amazon I probably don’t need to tell you that tanning is bad for literally everything to do with your skin, but Dr. Howe specifically warns against tanning as a quick fix for body acne. “That might work for a few weeks,” he says, “but once you’re out of the sun your acne will undergo a rebound flare, and come roaring back even worse. Plus, you’ll have caused lifelong sun damage to your exposed skin.” For sun protection, Dr. Gmyrek swears by EltaMD products for acne-prone skin — they’re lightweight, non-comedogenic, and guard your skin against both UVB and UVA rays (the former are responsible for sunburns, the latter cause sun spots, and both can cause skin cancer). Use EltaMD UV Sport Broad-Spectrum SPF 50 on your chest (and the rest of your body) for up to 80 minutes of acne-safe, water-resistant sun protection. The non-greasy formula doesn’t leave behind a white cast, so it works beautifully on all skin tones.

4. Keep Pores Clean With Exfoliating Pads Neutrogena Rapid Clear Treatment Pads $7 | Amazon See on Amazon Using salicylic acid-soaked treatment pads can be an effective, mess-free, and oddly satisfying way to treat chest acne. These Neutrogena Rapid Clear Treatment Pads clear away dirt, oil, and other bacteria to treat current acne flare-ups and prevent future breakouts. A word of warning: Since they’re intended for treating facial acne, these pads are highly concentrated and might be too drying for run-of-the-mill chest acne. Reserve them for more severe breakouts, or if you have very oily skin.",https://www.bustle.com/p/how-to-get-rid-of-chest-acne-according-to-a-dermatologist-21731523,,,

In December last year, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray had directed the officials of the Tourism Department to chalk out a plan to build a world-class aquarium in Mumbai.

""An international standard tourism complex would come up on the Worli Dairy land with an estimated cost of Rs 1,000 crore. An international standard aquarium will be built there,"" Pawar said while presenting his budget in the Legislative Assembly.

Pawar, who also holds the finance portfolio, presented the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government's maiden budget in the Lower House.

He announced an outlay of Rs 1,400 crore for the Department of Tourism. Aaditya Thackeray, son of the chief minister, is the state Tourism and Minister.

Pawar also announced creation of a special fund to combat global warming and climate change, the issues over which Aaditya Thackeray has time and again expressed concerns.

Pawar said several pilgrimage spots in the state, including Mahurgad in Nanded district, Parli Vaijanath, Aundha Nagnath, Narsi Namdev in Hingoli district, ancient Shiva temple in Ambarnath and Hazrat Khwaja Shamna Mira Dargah in Miraj, would be developed.

For the development of popular tourist destinations, such as Mahabaleshwar and Panchgani Rs 100 crore have been set aside in the budget.

The government also set aside Rs 55 crore for the diamond jubilee celebrations of the state, which was formed on May 1, 1960.

Besides, Rs 25 crore have been allocated for the 150th birth anniversary celebrations of Mahatma Gandhi.

The budget also increased the MLA fund from Rs 2 crore (declared in 2011) to Rs 3 crore. Pawar said the move is aimed at enabling the elected representatives to spend more in their constituencies.

Gavin Newsom ordered the closure of all Orange County beaches to stem the spread of the coronavirus, state officials have announced that three beach cities will be permitted to reopen their stretches of coastline this week with certain limitations.

Dana Point, Huntington Beach and Seal Beach submitted plans to Sacramento that would allow the public to immediately access the coastline for active recreation only. The plans, approved Tuesday, include a range of measures to avoid overcrowding and allow safe physical distancing, according to the California Natural Resources Agency.

Under Huntington Beach’s plan, people are now permitted to use the beach from 5 a.m. to 10 p.m. with the stipulation that they remain active. Sunbathing is not allowed. Parking meters along Pacific Coast Highway and the beach’s bike path are available for use, but the pier and the city’s beach parking lot will remain closed.

“We’re delighted to be reopening our beaches for active recreation, which will allow our community to once again enjoy the recreational and mental health benefits from spending time in the Pacific Ocean,” Mayor Lyn Semeta said in a prepared statement. “The new active recreation rules that we’re instituting will allow for continued beach access in a manner that emphasizes the need to practice safe social distancing.”

Seal Beach’s coastline will be open — beginning Monday — for limited hours Monday through Thursday with the requirement that visitors remain active while on the sand.

Officials in Dana Point said their beaches will also only be open to walking, running and recreational uses like swimming and surfing. No gatherings will be permitted, but the public can still access the city’s tide pools.

Dana Point City Manager Mike Killebrew said in a statement that he hopes “everyone understands how important it is that we all follow new guidelines that will promote socially responsible recreation and enjoyment by the public.”

“We know how important our beaches are to the residents of Dana Point. And we know how much residents value, especially now, access to our beautiful coastline,” he said.

State-operated beaches within the Huntington Beach and Dana Point city limits also reopened with the same active-recreation protocols, city officials said.

The move came a day after similar plans for Laguna Beach and San Clemente were approved by the state.

The only coastal city that has not yet gained approval from the state to reopen is Newport Beach. The city, just a few miles south of Huntington Beach, also submitted a plan to Sacramento on Saturday to safely reopen their coastline, said city spokesman John Pope.

“We have been closely coordinating with Huntington Beach about strategies to enhance the management of our beaches,” Pope said. “Despite repeated attempts by city staff to connect with state officials, we have not yet received any information on an approval or modifications, or when a decision might be made.”

Newsom last week ordered a “hard close” of all Orange County beaches. The order came after an April heat wave sent thousands to the sand in some beach communities. Newsom called the images circulating of people congregating on Orange County’s shores “disturbing.”

The closure prompted a legal showdown between cities and the state, as well as outrage from the public . Some argued that the governor was targeting Orange County based on photographs that did not show the full scope of what was happening on the beaches.

Newsom on Tuesday praised local leaders in Orange County beach cities for working with his administration to reach an agreement. Just days ago, city leaders in Huntington Beach and Dana Point voted to take legal action against the governor.

Huntington Beach City Atty. Michael Gates said the city is continuing to move forward with its request for an injunction against the governor’s order despite the beaches being allowed to reopen.

Newsom said his administration has been negotiating with the beach cities since the weekend and said he hoped to make a future announcement about beach access in Orange County soon.

“It’s a spirit of collaboration and cooperation that is necessary as we move forward,” Newsom said during his daily COVID-19 briefing in Sacramento.

On Tuesday, the Orange County Board of Supervisors voted to submit a plan to the state that would allow county-operated beaches to reopen for active recreation.

Supervisor Lisa Bartlett, who proposed the item, said it would help put county beaches in line with what was happening in nearby cities and allow people to get out and recreate along the coast.

“We want people to walk and jog and run and enjoy water sports but to keep moving,” she said, “and the state is fully behind that.”

Supervisor Don Wagner opposed the motion, along with Supervisor Michelle Steel, saying any restrictions on beach activity were arbitrary and that it was appalling that the county would bow to rules the governor put in place without input from local officials.

“This is exactly what we shouldn’t be doing as a government,” Wagner said.

3970,1484188851,,"Over 1,700 Irish citizens required DFA assistance overseas in 2019",en,,,,"Major incidents such as terrorist attacks, protests and missing people prompt calls","The Department of Foreign Affairs assisted 1,723 Irish citizens caught up in major incidents overseas last year.

These incidents included terrorist attacks in Sri Lanka and Kenya, protests in Hong Kong and political instability in South America.

Medical emergencies were the most common cause of contact, with 270 people requiring assistance for that.

Over 260 families required the support of the Department following the death of a loved one abroad, while 243 people needed help with overseas arrests.

Some 112 people were victims of crime in another country, while72 families required help tracing a missing person.

The Department assisted these people through its consular office in Dublin, in its 80 embassies and consulates-general, and in the 94 honorary consuls around the world.

One of the most notable cases in which the Department provided assistance was that of teenager Nora Quoirin, whose body was found in a Malaysian rainforest after a 10-day search.

In April 2019 a series of terrorist attacks on churches and luxury hotels in Sri Lanka left 259 people dead, many of them tourists.

The Department of Foreign Affairs advised people to stay indoors and obey the curfew that was in place at the time, saying they could contact the Honorary Consul in Colombo for assistance if needed.

Commenting on the figures, Minister Simon Coveney said:

“Irish citizens continue to travel more often and more widely than ever before - meaning a greater frequency and complexity of consular cases. This presents ever-growing challenges in providing assistance for Irish citizens who get into difficulty overseas.

“While most journeys overseas go smoothly, the 2019 statistics show that things can and do go wrong and that it is important to be prepared. As people consider travel plans for the year ahead, I urge them to get comprehensive travel insurance.”",https://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/over-1-700-irish-citizens-required-dfa-assistance-overseas-in-2019-1.4128156,,,

After the number of confirmed cases of Covid-19 rose to 150 on March 19 2020, Minister of Public Works and Infrastructure Patricia de Lille identified 37 sites across all nine provinces to be used as isolation and quarantine facilities. There were 202 confirmed cases the following day.

The government plans to erect a 40km-long fence at the Beitbridge border post within the next month to prevent undocumented or infected people from crossing the border into South Africa from Zimbabwe and vice versa. De Lille said the project will cost about R37.2-million.

Having already shut down all sporting and cultural events, state officials are now scrambling to try to limit disruptions to the legislative bodies that oversee the administration of the country.

Municipal disruption

While these bodies review ways to keep the country up and running, continued social restrictions might pose a threat to local municipal budgets. Councils have until May 30 to pass their budgets, but officials say the government’s ban on gatherings of more than 100 people may prevent them from sitting to table their budgets.

Council members have a grace period of 30 days, until the end of June each year, to comply with the budget deadline. Otherwise they risk being dissolved, forcing political parties to participate in by-elections.

The Metsimaholo local municipality in the northern Free State had to hold by-elections in 2017 when its coalition council failed to approve its 2017-2018 budget in time, resulting in the council’s dissolution.

Free State Department of Cooperative Governance, Traditional Affairs and Human Settlements spokesperson Zolile Lobe conceded that the coronavirus pandemic is going to disrupt council meetings. “We are concerned that the pandemic might disrupt the tabling of budgets, but we will assess the situation as it unfolds,” Lobe said, stressing that contact between officials will be minimal in line with the national government’s directive on social distancing.

Residents of municipalities already in crisis, such as Maluti-a-Phofung in the eastern Free State and Makana in the Eastern Cape, are at the mercy of municipal officials to supply much-needed water to counter the spread of the virus.

Despite a cancelled plenary sitting of the National Assembly on March 17, the National Council of Provinces (NCOP) met on March 19 to endorse Gauteng Premier David Makhura’s decision two weeks ago to invoke Section 139 of the Constitution and dissolve the Tshwane council. The metro has been running without a mayor or municipal manager as several attempts to elect a new mayor have descended into chaos.

Parliamentary spokesperson Moloto Mothapo said “every activity, public hearings and committee meetings included, are suspended” in line with government measures to curb the spread of Covid-19.

The NCOP cancelled public meetings in three Gauteng municipalities that formed part of the three-day report-back session of the council’s flagship programme, Taking Parliament to the People.

The North West provincial legislature has shut its doors to the public. “All outreach programmes of the legislature are suspended with immediate effect and will be resuscitated after 14 April 2020,” it said.

Lobe said on March 19 that Thembeni Nxangisa, a Free State member of the executive council for cooperative governance and traditional affairs, was heading to QwaQwa to find ways to make water available to residents to improve hygiene. It has taken a life-threatening pandemic to get the government to respond to the area’s 10-year-long dry spell.

The government plans to release water from Maluti-a-Phofung’s main water source, the Fika-Patso Dam, to give residents a fighting chance, said Lobe. “From today, Thursday to Sunday, the municipality is opening water to the people for hygiene purposes to curb Covid-19. We will also increase water tankers.”

Adhere, or face charges

On March 19, Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma stressed the importance of adhering to the Covid-19 regulations the government has put in place. She added that the government will be taking action against those who refuse medical treatment or take part in mass gatherings and intentionally infect others with Covid-19.

Minister of Police Bheki Cele has vowed to clamp down on alcohol consumers and traders who do not adhere to the new restrictions Dlamini-Zuma has gazetted, which limit trading hours and customer numbers.

Political parties are also taking heed of social restrictions. The Economic Freedom Fighters and the ANC have cancelled major gatherings and events, and the Democratic Alliance’s federal executive has postponed its policy conference that was scheduled to take place on April 4 and 5.

4078,1517836852,,別利用主席身份抨擊政黨 陳國彬：公會應超越政治,en,,,,,"（古晋11日讯）民主行动党实旦宾支部宣传秘书陈国彬指出，随着砂州选举脚步越来越近，许多立场中立的公会也因为其主席的政治立场而开始似有意似无意的攻击希盟政府的政策，其中更是将矛头指向行动党,政治意图显而易见.

其中,陈国彬表示,一些拥有其政治立场的公会主席甚至以他们主席的身份公开的表明支持人联党,也将20%石油税未能归还以及砂拉越地位不能还原归咎成是希盟政府的过错;对此,陈国彬质疑,这些以公会主席身份所发表的言论是不是就代表整个公会会员的意愿? 又或者是自身的政治立场而已?

也是前实旦宾区国会议员的陈国彬也说到,公会主席若要公开表明其政治立场的话,不应该利用其公会的平台,更不应该利用其公会主席的身份,因为这样的言论是代表了整个公会的立场.他强调,公会可以关心政治,但是更应该超越政治立场.

对于20%石油税以及砂拉越地位迟迟未能还原,陈国彬重申,砂希盟主席张健仁已经多次表明希盟的献议，那就是增加砂州石油开采税至20％及归还50％砂本土税收予砂政府，惟这笔增加的收入将用在医药和教育领域。但是砂政盟却不愿意接受,只愿意拿钱但是却不愿意回馈给砂拉越人民.

不仅如此,希盟政府在执政联邦后,在执政后不到一年的时间就提呈修宪,还原砂拉越三邦之一的地位时,但砂政盟却为了他们的政治议程利益而选择联手巫统以及伊斯兰党拒绝投票,二度出卖砂拉越而导致了修宪的失败,这也让砂拉越人多年的期盼落空.

“若不是砂政盟（GPS）的刻意不接受，砂拉越的地位以及20%石油税早就在希盟执政联邦后的一年内已经归还，今天的砂拉越也不会继续成为马来西亚的13州之一.”

对此,陈国彬希望公会主席不要再一味的选择漂白砂政盟,因为人民的眼睛是雪亮的,人民将会清楚的看到砂政盟是如何的二度出卖砂拉越,也会清楚的看见砂政盟是如何的罔顾砂拉越人民的利益.

“在希盟执政后,虽然不尽完美,但是我希望一些公会主席不要选择性看不见,在希盟廉正的管理下,马来西亚的贪污印象指数(CPI)在全球的180个国家当中,从61名提升至10位至51位,而这只是希盟执政后的其中一个佳绩而已.”",https://eunited.com.my/352085/,,,

The Jayhawks (24-3, 13-1 Big 12) received 62 of 64 first-place votes from the national media panel to take over the No. 1 ranking for the second time this season. Kansas also was atop the poll for one week in December, when it seemed as if just about every school that ascended to No. 1 promptly lost in a topsy-turvy start to the season.

“We’re a silent team that can make a run late in March,” Jayhawks guard Devon Dotson said after the 64-61 victory on Saturday. “We’re not going to get complacent from this one. We’re going to build off of it.”

Baylor (24-2, 13-1) received two first-place votes and fell to second after its 23-game winning streak came to an end. Gonzaga was No. 3 after a loss to BYU, and Dayton jumped San Diego State for No. 4 after the Aztecs lost for the first time in a week when every team in the top 10 found itself in a new position from last week.

The most notable change, of course, came at the top.

“Baylor is the best team that we’ve played against since I’ve been in the league the last 17 years,” said Jayhawks coach Bill Self, whose team begins its four-game finishing stretch against Oklahoma State on Monday night. “You could look at Oklahoma State in ’04 and you could look at (Texas) Tech in ’19, but I think Baylor has played better than both those teams at the same stage. I don’t know how it’s going to finish, but I certainly feel strongly about that.”

Baylor coach Scott Drew, whose team spent five weeks at No. 1, was equally effusive in his praise for the Jayhawks.

“Kansas has really progressed since the last time we faced them,” he said. “We had a heck of a run. I never thought I’d see anyone do what we did. The Big 12 is so tough. Six straight years we’ve been the number one conference for a reason.”

Baylor wasn’t the only team to take its lumps during an upset-filled weekend.

The Cougars continued their climb to No. 17 after they knocked off Gonzaga on Saturday night, while UNLV ended the Aztecs’ perfect start with a 66-63 victory. Two more top-10 teams went down in a Big Ten shakeup Sunday when Maryland lost to Ohio State and Penn State lost to Indiana for its second defeat of the week.

“We lost, and it’s the first time it’s happened (this season), so it doesn’t feel good,” San Diego State guard Malachi Flynn said. “We were all just trying to win the game, and it’s just played out the way it played out.”

The Flyers (25-2) have won 16 straight to reach their highest standing in the poll since finishing third during the 1955-56 season, while the Aztecs (26-1) remain the nation’s only one-loss Division I team. They were followed by Florida State, Duke, Kentucky, Maryland and Creighton in rounding out the top 10.

The Seminoles climbed two spots ahead of their high-profile ACC showdown with No. 11 Louisville on Monday night. Related Articles Pac-12 recap: UCLA, ASU surge while Oregon collects key win

“Florida State is just a team, they’re all really big, really long and really athletic,” Cardinals star Jordan Nwora said. “We’re going to pressure them, use the lane, and I feel pretty confident going into this game.”

RISING AND FALLING

The Blue Jays climbed from No. 15 into the top 10 for the first time since the 2016-17 season after beating then-No. 19 Marquette and then-No. 21 Butler last week. Their streak has moved them to within a game of Seton Hall — which climbed from No. 16 to No. 13 this week — in what has become an intrigue race for the Big East title.

The biggest jump this week came from BYU, which followed a victory over Santa Clara with a resounding 91-78 win over Gonzaga. The Cougars climbed six spots to No. 17 with their eighth straight victory.

Penn State took the biggest tumble from ninth to No. 16 after losses to Illinois and Indiana, while West Virginia fell three spots to No. 20 and Colorado dropped three spots to No. 21.

IN AND OUT

Michigan shot back into the Top 25 at No. 19 this week after the Wolverines ran their winning streak to five straight and seven of eight with victories at Purdue and Rutgers. Texas Tech and Michigan State also returned to the poll with the Red Raiders at No. 22 and the Spartans at No. 24.

Marquette tumbled from No. 19 all the way out after losing to Creighton and unranked Providence. Butler fell out from No. 21 and Arizona from No. 24 after the Wildcats lost in overtime to Oregon on Saturday.

May 23 (UPI) -- Good Omens stars David Tennant and Michael Sheen are reuniting for a six-episode BBC comedy called Staged. The 15-minute show will debut in June. It follows the cast of a play who continue to rehearse remotely after their upcoming West End production is suddenly brought to a halt because of the coronavirus pandemic. Advertisement

""Absurd and humorous in equal measure, Staged takes on the challenges of creating a drama in lockdown, on stage and off, with a line-up including Georgia Tennant, Lucy Eaton and Anna Lundberg,"" a BBC press release said. ""The show will also have a selection of guest stars including Nina Sosanya, with more to be confirmed in due course.""

Simon Evans and Phin Glynn came up with the idea and Evans penned the screenplay.

It will be recorded using video-conference technology in keeping with social-distancing practices.

Marvel boss Kevin Feige confirmed that the Marvel Cinematic Universe is getting their first transgender character.

After pleas for Marvel to include more LGBTQ+ characters in their franchise, Kevin appears to have delivered in The Eternals.

When asked at the New York Film Academy whether there were any plans to introduce more diverse characters, specifically transgender characters, the 46-year-old producer said: ‘Yes, absolutely yes.

‘Very soon, in a movie, we’re shooting right now, yes.’

Kevin never specified which movie the character will appear in, but The Eternals is currently the only project in the middle of filming.

The Eternals stars Angelina Jolie, Richard Madden, Kumail Nanjiani, and Salma Hayek.

According to Kevin, The Eternals will also be getting a gay character, who is ‘married, he’s got a family, and that is just part of who he is.’

Kevin revealed The Eternals also has a gay character (Picture: Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP, File)

On 7 December, a few lucky fans were treated to a first look at The Eternals, giving a glimpse at Angelina and Salma’s characters.

Kevin hosted a panel at Comic-con in Sao Paolo where he unveiled a fresh look at Scarlett Johansson’s Black Widow after the official trailer dropped last week.

But it was The Eternals preview which had everyone talking as it’s been kept tightly under wraps since news of the movie broke earlier this year.

And while the first look footage still isn’t available for the wider public, a group of lucky Comic-Con attendees were able to watch a short clip.

According to Deadline, the video showed a blonde Angelina ‘kicking some major a*s’ during a huge fight scene and, frankly, we wouldn’t expect anything less.

The rest of the heroes are then shown in different parts of the world before the footage closes with Salma’s character Ajak stating: ‘This world has changed us. We must protect it.’

Falleció el cantautor español Luis Eduardo Aute

En este artículo: Camagüey, Cuba, Cultura, música, Luis Eduardo Aute

Madrid, 4 abr.- El conocido cantautor español Luis Eduardo Aute falleció hoy en un hospital madrileño a los 76 años, según fuentes de su entorno familiar citadas por diversos medios de comunicación.

Considerado uno de los principales referentes de la canción de autor en España, Aute (Manila, 13 de septiembre de 1943) estaba retirado de los escenarios desde el verano de 2016, cuando sufrió un grave infarto que lo mantuvo casi dos meses en coma.

El músico, artista plástico, cineasta y poeta cumplió ese año medio siglo de carrera y se disponía a cerrar las actuaciones en las Fiestas Colombinas de Huelva.

La sureña ciudad andaluza era una de las paradas de su tour La Gira Luna, en la que cantó algunas de sus canciones más emblemáticas como La belleza, Al alba, Pasaba por aquí, Rosas en el mar, Sin tu latido y Una de dos, que forman parte del disco homenaje Giralunas.

Para celebrar el 50 aniversario de su primera grabación de estudio, organizó el tour La Gira Luna, que arrancó con un recital en el Auditorio Nacional de México y le llevó a recorrer España con 15 conciertos, uno de ellos el 21 de junio en Madrid en el marco de una iniciativa solidaria para ayudar a los refugiados.

El 8 de agosto de ese año sufrió un infarto y estuvo 48 días en coma. Se recuperó con lentitud y en 2018 sus compañeros le hicieron un concierto homenaje.

Una veintena de artistas, entre ellos Joaquín Sabina, Joan Manuel Serrat, el cubano Silvio Rodríguez o Ana Belén, se unieron en una noche histórica para enviar ánimos al artista.

Unos meses antes de enfermar, Aute participó en conciertos solidarios para recaudar fondos de ayuda a los refugiados sirios.

En mayo de 2016 acompañó incluso al trovador cubano en una multitudinaria presentación gratuita en el barrio madrileño de Vallecas, con el objetivo de recaudar donativos económicos y materiales para los afectados por el terremoto ocurrido un mes antes en Ecuador.

La última fábula que le gustaba contar a Aute tenía como protagonista un girasol insumiso. Lo hacía llamar el Giraluna, un girasol que, a diferencia del resto, decidía no agachar la cabeza por la noche y aguardaba la llegada de la luna, recordó hoy el diario El País.

“El Giraluna, ese elemento disidente y diferenciador entre la caterva, podía ser el propio Aute, el juglar político, cantautor de inmensas canciones de amor, el poeta de lo cotidiano, el artista plástico, el amante del cine, el sutil soñador y el anciano de verbo perspicaz e indignado por los desajustes de un mundo siempre desajustado”, subrayó el matutino.

Las décadas de 1970 y 1980 del pasado siglo fueron las de mayor repercusión de este polifacético creador, en coincidencia con la restauración de la democracia en España y el auge de los cantautores.

Junto a los nombres de Joan Manuel Serrat, Joaquín Sabina o Paco Ibañez, el suyo trasciende la mera interpretación para alcanzar a la memoria colectiva de varias generaciones.

Das sieht ein Gesetz von Bundesarbeitsminister Hubertus Heil (SPD) vor, das der Bundestag am Donnerstag verabschiedet hat. Die neuen technischen Möglichkeiten sollen ab 2022 genutzt werden können.

Das Gesetz sieht zudem eine stärkere Förderung der Weiterbildung von Arbeitnehmerinnen und Arbeitnehmern in besonders vom Strukturwandel betroffenen Betrieben vor. Geringqualifizierte Arbeitnehmer sollen außerdem einen Anspruch darauf bekommen, einen Berufsabschluss nachzuholen.

Wegen der Corona-Krise wurde das ""Gesetz zur Förderung der beruflichen Weiterbildung im Strukturwandel und zur Weiterentwicklung der Ausbildungsförderung"" um aktuelle Hilfsmaßnahmen ergänzt: So sollen Betriebsratsbeschlüsse bis Jahresende auch per Video- und Telefonkonferenz gefasst werden dürfen. Auch Betriebsversammlungen dürfen solange audio-visuell durchgeführt werden. Die Bundesregierung bekommt mit dem Gesetz zudem wie geplant das Recht, schon bei ""Teilstörungen auf dem Arbeitsmarkt"" per Verordnung die Grenze für die Zahlung von Kurzarbeit von bisher maximal 12 auf bis zu 24 Monate auszudehnen.

“Days after he publicly mused that scientists should explore the injection of toxic disinfectants as a potential virus cure, Trump has now rejected the utility of his daily task force briefings, where he has time and again clashed with scientific experts. Trump’s aides are aiming to move the president onto more familiar — and safer, they hope — ground: talking up the economy, in tighter controlled settings.”

Un giovane è stato pizzicato dopo aver spacciato alcuni grammi, un altro è stato sorpreso mentre nascondeva la provvista

Serata movimentata in Val Venosta. I Carabinieri setacciano la valle dall’alto in basso alla ricerca di droga e spacciatori.

Nell’ambito dei servizi di controllo del territorio per la prevenzione e repressione dei reati in genere e in particolare in materia di stupefacenti, i Carabinieri della Compagnia di Silandro hanno arrestato due persone in flagranza di reato a poche decine di minuti di distanza.

La prima operazione è stata condotta nel tardo pomeriggio dai militari della Stazione Carabinieri di Malles Venosta, in collaborazione con quelli di Sluderno e Resia all’Adige.

Gli operanti hanno monitorato gli spostamenti di un soggetto già sospettato di spacciare droga che si muoveva in treno e che a Spondigna si è incontrato con una giovane ragazza.



Quest’ultima è stata poi fermata, perquisita e trovata in possesso di alcuni grammi di marijuana appena acquistati dall’uomo per cinquanta euro.

Lo spacciatore, un ventunenne cittadino del Bangladesh già noto per reati contro il patrimonio, richiedente asilo ospite presso il centro di accoglienza di Malles Venosta, è stato quindi bloccato e trovato in possesso dei cinquanta euro ricevuti dalla ragazza e di ulteriori dodici grammi di stupefacente, inoltre nella sua stanza è stata rinvenuta e sequestrata anche una bicicletta provento di furto.

Pertanto l’uomo è stato dichiarato in stato di arresto e accompagnato in caserma per i rilevi foto-dattiloscopici.

Quindi, informato il pubblico ministero, è stato posto agli arresti domiciliari presso la medesima struttura a disposizione dell’autorità giudiziaria.

La ragazza è stata segnalata all’Autorità di Governo per la sanzione prevista per gli assuntori di stupefacenti.



Il secondo arresto è avvenuto un’ora dopo circa a Plaus, dove i militari del nucleo operativo della Compagnia Carabinieri di Silandro hanno bloccato e controllato un diciannovenne di Merano sorpreso mentre si introduceva furtivamente nelle pertinenze di un’abitazione.

I militari credevano di aver sventato un furto in abitazione, reato che in questi giorni preoccupa molto i militari dell’Arma in quanto la fase di coprifuoco COVID aveva tenuto tutti in casa e fatto crollare a picco i furti in abitazione, mentre ora che tutti escono i ladri professionali sicuramente vorranno recuperare il tempo perso nei due mesi di ferie forzate.

Nel campo dei reati contro il patrimonio infatti lo smartworking è difficilmente applicabile…



I militari si sono stupiti nel constatare che in realtà il giovane non stava cercando di rubare ma di occultare un involucro di nylon contente più di mezzo chilogrammo di marijuana, la cui detenzione illegale gli è costata l’arresto in flagranza di reato.

Il diciannovenne, peraltro incensurato, non era noto per frequentare il giro dello spaccio ma evidentemente aveva intravisto un margine di facile guadagno, non facendo però i conti con la Legge, e con i Carabinieri.

Dopo essere stato foto-segnalato, è stato accompagnato al carcere di Bolzano a disposizione dell’autorità giudiziaria.

The state housing authority plans to conduct the draw of lots in a month’s time. However, the authority will finalise the date only once the ministry portfolios are distributed.

The official asserted that as cabinet expansion has taken place on December 30, the portfolios accumulated with the six cabinet ministers, who took oath along with Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray in the first round, will now be distributed. Currently, NCP’s Jayant Patil is in charge of the housing ministry. Though a meeting was conducted with Minister Patil, only after portfolios are confirmed a detailed presentation about the BDD chawls’ redevelopment project will be made and the date for the draw of lots decided, explained the official.

Interestingly, the NM Joshi Marg BDD Chawls Phase-1 project construction work was expected to begin last year after Diwali. However, unable to vacate the first 10 chawls the project missed the deadline, and the plan failed to take off.

This paper had reported that in a bid to expedite the shifting of tenants, the MHADA has come up with an offer asking tenants to shift to transit houses wherein on first come first basis they will get an opportunity to participate in the lottery draw. By conducting this lottery draw, the participant tenants will know which floors of the new buildings their houses will be located. The lottery for rehab houses will be held from the top floors of the 22-storeyed building.

Besides, MHADA will also sign an agreement with the lottery winners, giving a surety that they will get their houses back, unlike the city’s other stuck redevelopment projects undertaken mostly by the private developers.

MHADA is drawing the lottery of top floor houses after tenants even after repeated appeals were not willing to leave their houses and shift to the provided alternative places. Following which, this offer was made in a bid to lure residents of getting houses on the top floors of the buildings once ready. So far, 252 families have shifted to the transit houses, informed the official.

At NM Joshi, the authority as per the approved plans will construct seven towers comprising 22 floors each in phase-1, which will house 1,200 tenements. To construct the seven new towers, 10 existing chawls are required to be demolished first.

The tenants of NM Joshi Marg, including Dadar-Naigaon BDD Chawl tenants, are provided alternative accommodation in mill buildings. Ruby Mill, Jubilee Mill, Prakash Cotton Mill, Western India Mill, Century Mill, and Bharat Mill are the six mills that have been identified and have a total of 1,127 transit houses, according to the MHADA.

The then chief minister Devendra Fadnavis had performed the ground-breaking ceremony in April 2017. However, till date, not a single brick has been laid. MHADA, on the other end, is still convincing residents to support the redevelopment of century-old BDD chawls, which have been planned costing of Rs 17,000 crore approximately. If successfully completed, about 16,000 families living in BDD chawls at NM Joshi, Naigaon and Worli will get new 500 square feet of flats free of cost.",https://in.news.yahoo.com/awaited-redevelopment-bdd-chawls-nm-193547846.html,,,

The family of a man who was stabbed to death in Derby bravely listened to his last moments as a harrowing 999 call was played in court.

The son and daughter of Simon Jones heard how former armed forces member John King tried in vain to save their dad by performing CPR on him on the driveway where had collapsed.

Moments earlier the 57-year-old had been stabbed three times to the legs in a car park. He managed to stagger to Mr King’s front door before banging on it and then collapsing.

A haunting 999 call to the emergency services heard Mr King’s son – Dean King – talk the call handler through what his father was doing to try and keep Mr Jones, himself a former RAF man, alive.

Three men are on trial at Derby Crown Court after being charged with murder and conspiracy to rob.

Kirk Guy, John Williams and Jacob Ali, all of Chaddesden, deny the charges.

The harrowing 999 call

In the call, Dean King tells the operator: “Someone keeps banging on the door saying ‘help me, help me’.

“I don’t know what to do.”

The operator replies: “Can you see anybody?”

Mr King says: “I am talking to the person that’s with him he says he’s been stabbed, there’s a lot of blood, he’s not conscious, I don’t think he’s breathing.

“My dad is going to perform CPR, he’s been in the armed forces and knows how to do CPR.”

The operator asks: “Can his (Mr Jones’) friend (Mr Calladine) help?”

Mr King replies: “He is too traumatised, he’s running around in the road.”

The operator says: “I have officers travelling to you.”

Mr King says: “He’s (Mr Jones) started breathing, my dad can’t see a wound, he’s trying to find a wound now.

“He (Mr Jones) keeps gasping for air.

“There’s movement but it’s very weak.”

The operator asks: “Where is his friend (Mr Calladine) now?”

Mr King replies: “He’s run off towards the park I think.

“There’s lots of blood, it’s dripping all down the driveway.

“My dad says he’s breathing but it’s very weak.”

Moments later the emergence services arrive and take over trying unsuccessfully to save Mr Jones’ life.

Elsewhere during today's proceedings, the jury was told that Williams - the man who is alleged to have physically stabbed Mr Jones - later sent damning messages over Facebook which “are akin to a confession” that he was responsible for the death.

In them, the 24-year-old thanks his girlfriend for sticking with him and tells her she is “not going to have him around for a long time”.

And in a message to his step-brother, he asks his sibling to look after his young son and “teach him how to be a man”.

Peter Joyce QC, prosecuting, said after the stabbing of Mr Jones, at around 9.45pm on April 20 last year, Williams moved to a friend’s address in Belper to “lie low”.

Facebook messages

He said: “In a Facebook message that is clearly from Williams to his girlfriend, he says ‘my baby girl I am sorry for everything. I did not mean to put you through all this and (after) everything I have done you still stick by me. I am sorry you are not going to have me around for a long time’.""

Mr Joyce continued: ""Why is he saying that? We say it is because he knows exactly what he has done and that he is not going to be around in her life.

“It is akin to a confession to his girlfriend.”

Mr Joyce said four minutes after sending that message, Williams then sent a Facebook message to his step-brother.

He said: “In it he says ‘My brother make sure you look after JJ [his baby son]’. He then says to him ‘teach him how to be a man, love you bro’.

“This is a very, very, small child. He then instructs him (his step-brother) at the end to ‘delete all these messages’.”

The trial has already heard how Mr Jones travelled to the car park with Mr Calladine to carry out a drug deal on the evening of April 20, 2019.

Mr Calladine, who worked for Mr Jones’ bailiff company, had allegedly set the exchange up with Guy two days earlier while the pair were at the Atlanta Gym, in Dunton Close, Derby.

The court heard the deal involved “several thousands of pounds of cocaine”.

But the prosecution claim Guy arranged for Williams and Ali to rob them of the drugs instead.

Chaddesden Park

Opening the case on Thursday, Mr Joyce said Calladine was robbed at knifepoint and ran away so Williams approached Mr Jones who was in the passenger seat of his VW Transporter gang and stabbed him.

Mr Jones, having suffered fatal stab wounds to his legs, managed to stagger out of the car park leaving a trail of blood and to the front door of the King family in nearby Chaddesden Lane.

The occupants rang 999 and tried in vain to save the victim who was pronounced dead just over an hour later at the Royal Derby Hospital.

Mr Joyce told the hearing that in the aftermath of the stabbing the knife was taken back to Ali’s address, in Chaddesden, where is was cleaned using bleach in a mop bucket.

He said it was then wrapped and transported to an address in Alvaston where it was later discovered concealed in a water tank and recovered by police.

The mobile phone stolen from Mr Calladine was found in shrubbery in Kiwi Park, also in Alvaston.

Mr Joyce said: “The prosecution case is that it was Williams that actually stabbed Simon Jones and that the others, Guy and Ali, either intended to assist him or intended to both rob him and cause him really serious injury or to kill him in the course of the robbery.

“Guy set it up, Ali drove Williams to the scene and Williams was the killer.

“It does not matter for the purposes of this case whether the drugs were taken in the VW Transporter van to Chaddesden Park belonged to Carl Calladine or Simon Jones.

“What matters is that Guy, Ali and Williams knew the cocaine would be there and intended to steal it.

“There was no indication (in arranging the drug deal) that Mr Jones would even be there that night.

“But when Mr Calladine runs away Mr Williams goes to the van and sadly, so sadly, there was someone else there and that’s Simon Jones.

“And for being there, Simon Jones pays with his life.”

Members of Mr Jones family as well as supporters of Guy, 34, of Haydn Road, Williams, 24, of Waterford Drive, and Ali, 20, of Ashworth Avenue, all in Chaddesden, were all in court to hear the case opened.

His family have previously described him as “a true gentleman who was adored by everyone”.

The trial, which is scheduled to last up to six weeks, continues.",https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/news/derby-news/grandads-family-bravely-listen-harrowing-3751578,,,
4407,1544695356,['Hemant Waje'],13 of 22 rebel Cong MLAs won't quit Cong: Digvijaya,en,,,,Singh said nobody anticipated that Scindia would quit the party.,"Thirteen of the 22 rebel Congress MLAs in Madhya Pradesh don't want to quit the party and were led away only to create pressure on the leadership to nominate Jyotiraditya Scindia to the Rajya Sabha, senior party leader Digvijaya Singh claimed on Wednesday.

He also asserted that the Kamal Nath-led government in the state, pushed to the brink of collapse with the resignation of 22 MLAs, will win a floor test.

On a day that Scindia joined the Bharatiya Janata Party, Singh said the former Union minister and four-time Lok Sabha MP from the Congress was offered the post of Madhya Pradesh deputy chief minister in 2018 when the party won the state elections but wanted his nominee appointed.

However, this was rejected by Kamal Nath as he didn't want a ""chela"" in that position, Singh said in an interview, a day after Scindia quit the Congress and 22 MLAs submitted their resignations from the assembly.

""The CM said he does not have any issue with Scindia becoming the deputy CM but told him, 'if you want your 'chela' to become deputy CM, then that will not happen'. Kamal Nath then took six of his (Scindia's) supporters in the cabinet,"" Singh revealed.

Two-three ministers close to Scindia as well as 10 of the rebel MLAs have given an assurance they are not leaving the Congress, he said.

""They were taken to Bengaluru to put pressure on the Congress to give Scindia a Rajya Sabha berth,"" Singh said.

""All the 22 MLAs, but for five or six, are Congress members who have been in Mr Scindia's group since Mr Madhavrao Scindia's time. So, all those people were there with him because they were with the Congress party,"" he added.

Singh said the party is in touch with the families of the MLAs.

""We are not keeping quiet. We are not sleeping,"" he declared.

Alleging the BJP's hand behind the crisis, he said the party's leaders carried the resignations of the Congress MLAs. Also, the BJP chartered flights to ferry Congress MLAs in two batches to Bengaluru, he claimed.

""It is all engineered, sponsored and paid for by the BJP... all part of the BJP's Operation Moneybag,"" he said and added that the phones of the rebel MLAs have been taken away and their conversations with family members are being recorded.

Singh admitted that the party did not anticipate that Scindia would leave the Congress to join the BJP and described the move as his ""ati-mahatvakansha"", or his over-ambition.

""We did not anticipate that Scindia will quit the Congress... that was a mistake. Someone who has got so much from the party- four-time MP, twice minister in Union Cabinet, Congress Working Committee member and party general secretary,"" he said.

""The Congress could have easily sent him to the Rajya Sabha with 122 MLAs on its side. But we could not have made him a cabinet minister. Only Modi-Shah can make (him) a cabinet minister not us,"" he added.

The remark was an oblique reference to reports that Scindia will be made a cabinet minister in the Modi government in return for his MLAs supporting BJP's Shivraj Singh Chouhan to form government in Madhya Pradesh.

""We will prove our majority. We will save the government,"" Singh said.

He also rejected theories of Scindia being unhappy with the party and the state government.

""In the entire Gwalior-Chambal region, the Congress is being run by Scindia. And even Kamal Nath ji ran the administrative machinery in coordination with him. Guna is my home district but even the SP and collector are appointed as per his (Scindia's) wishes. It's the same in Shivpuri, Gwalior, Ashok Nagar, Bhind and Morena.""

The two-time Madhya Pradesh chief minister said the assembly speaker, as per law, wants to verify the authenticity of the resignations tendered by the rebel MLAs by seeking their personal presence.

Detailing the sequence of events relating to the crisis in the state, he claimed Scindia was ""upset and frustrated"" when he lost the 2019 Lok Sabha elections and made overtures to Modi-Shah stating he could topple the Kamal Nath government.

""During the time, through a friend, he met Modi ji and Amit Shah,"" Singh said.

State BJP leaders were, however, opposed to the idea and were confident they could do the job themselves, he claimed, adding that Scindia was roped in when the local BJP leadership failed.

""Senior BJP leaders said if the government has to be brought down, we can do it, why do you have to take him (in the party). So they were asked to make an attempt. They tried...but we thwarted it.

""Then Amit Shah took them to task and said 'you are all useless ('nikamme nikle'), I am giving the task to (bring down the government) to Scindia ji',"" Singh claimed.

On his personal equation with Scindia, he said he had always remained in touch with Scindia and his father, the late Madhavrao Scindia.

Singh also recalled that he was instrumental in bringing Madhavrao Scindia to the Congress in 1979. Madhavrao Scindia's mother Vijaya Raje Scindia was one of the founding members of the BJP.

The Congress has a wafer thin majority in the 228-member assembly. Before the rebellion, its tally was 114. It also has the support of four Independents, two BSP MLAs and one from the SP, but some may now switch sides to the BJP.

If the resignations of the 22 MLAs are accepted, the strength of the assembly will fall to 206. The Congress, on its own, will then be left with 92 seats while the BJP has 107 seats with the magic number for a majority being 104.",https://www.rediff.com/news/report/13-of-22-rebel-cong-mlas-wont-quit-cong-digvijaya/20200311.htm,,,"['Jyotiraditya Scindia', 'Madhya Pradesh', 'Digvijaya Singh', 'Bharatiya Janata Party', 'Congress']"

Auf in eine neue Dekade: Neujahrsempfang des Businessclub CLUB TIROL mit BM Margarete Schramböck als Ehrenmitglied

Wien (pts019/14.01.2020/14:30) - ""Wir stehen am Beginn einer neuen Dekade, die für uns alle viele Änderungen bringen wird - manche sagen, angelehnt an den griechischen Philosophen Heraklit: Die einzige Konstante ist die Beschleunigung der Veränderung."" Einige nachdenkliche Worte sprach Julian Hadschieff, Präsident des Businessclub CLUB TIROL, bei seiner Begrüßung zum traditionellen Club-Neujahrsempfangs im Looshaus am Wiener Michaelerplatz. Veränderungen, so Hadschieff, soll man aber ""nicht nur als Herausforderung sehen, sondern als Chance, gute Lösungen für alle Menschen zu finden. Eine Aufgabe nicht nur für die Politik, sondern für uns alle"".

Dass der in Wien etablierte CLUB TIROL in der vergangenen Dekade eine erfolgreiche Entwicklung genommen hat, zeigte sich allein schon an der gut 200-köpfigen Gästeschar im zum Bersten gefüllten Mezzanin des Looshauses. Hadschieff: ""Aus dem kleinen Pflänzchen ist etwas geworden, bei unserem ersten Neujahrsempfang waren wir eine Handvoll Leute, jetzt ist die Zahl der VIPs schon unüberschaubar"". Allen voran durfte Hadschieff die alte-neue Wirtschaftsministerin und 2017 zur ""Tirolerin des Jahres"" gekürte Margarete Schramböck begrüßen. Diese wurde nun auch zum Ehrenmitglied des Clubs ernannt - was die nach ihrer halbjährlichen ministeriellen Auszeit hörbar wieder ""im Tiroler Dialekt erstarkte"" Neoministerin als ""besondere Ehre"" empfand.

Wiens ""Tiroler"" Tourismusdirektor

Als Ehrengast war diesmal Wiens Tourismusdirektor Norbert Kettner geladen. Der gebürtige Jenbacher - vor mehr als 30 Jahren wie viele andere Clubmitglieder zum Studieren nach Wien gekommen und geblieben - gab einen Einblick in die neue ""Visitor Economy Strategie 2025"" von Österreichs Hauptstadt. ""Veränderungen sind notwendig, damit das Reisen für viele Menschen möglich bleibt"", so Kettner. Global gibt es 1,4 Milliarden Reisende (2018) und ""nach den derzeitigen Prognosen werden es 2030 1,8 Milliarden sein"". Jedes Jahr wachse der ""globale"" Mittelstand"" (die Gruppe, die sich Reisen leisten kann) um 150 Millionen Menschen an, 88 Prozent davon stammen aus Asien. Wien zählt etwa in China nach Paris und London zum drittbeliebtesten europäischen Reiseziel.

Angesichts dieser Zahlen ist ""der Tourismus ein Bereich, den die Bevölkerung positiv wie negativ zu spüren bekommen kann"". Diskussionen darüber kenne man in Tirol wie in Wien sehr gut, oft werde der Tourismus für Dinge verantwortlich gemacht, für die er nichts könne. In der neuen ""Visitor Economy Strategie 2025"" habe Wien deshalb nicht nur die Interessen des Gastes, sondern auch jene der Bevölkerung berücksichtigt. Das heißt, die ""ausgezeichnete Lebensqualität der Stadt für die Bevölkerung zu erhalten und diese mit den Gästen zu teilen"". Dazu soll auch weiteres Wachstum dienen.

Konkret will Wien bis 2025 etwa den Beitrag des Tourismus zum Wiener BIP von 4 auf 6 Mrd. Euro steigern, Hotelumsätze sollen von 890 Millionen Euro (2018) auf 1,5 Milliarden Euro wachsen. Anders als früher wird daneben laufend die Bevölkerung befragt, wie ""es ihnen denn mit dem Tourismus so geht"". Neun von zehn Wienern seien aktuell zufrieden mit der Entwicklung, diesen ""Top-Wert wollen wir beibehalten, ebenso wie die hohe Zufriedenheit der Gäste - auch hier würden neun von zehn BesucherInnen Wien weiterempfehlen"". Weitere Ziele: Eine Verdopplung der Zahl der Wiener Betriebe mit dem Österreichischen Umweltzeichen auf dann rund 300 und ein ""sehr ambitionierter ist unser Plan, was die Anreise der Gäste betrifft"". Die Hälfte aller Wien-Besucher kommt derzeit mit dem Flugzeug, das ist bei Fernreisenden auch nicht anders möglich. 26 Prozent kommen allerdings mit dem Auto, 21 mit der Bahn. Kettner: ""Das wollen wir umdrehen - die Anreise per Zug wollen wir auf 26 Prozent steigern, jene mit dem Auto auf 21 Prozent reduzieren.""

Musik vom jungen ""Duo Minerva""

Nach dem Ausflug in die Tourismuswelt durften sich die Gäste an der musikalischen Darbietung des ""Duo Minerva"" erfreuen. Die aus Westendorf stammende 23-jährige Klarinettistin Johanna Gossner zeigte mit ihrem Vorarlberger Duo-Partner Damian Keller am Akkordeon - angefangen mit Herbert Pixners ""Diplomlandler"" bis hin zu Tangos von Astor Piazolla - ihr tolles Können. Danach durften sich alle an dem vom Sponsor dieses Abends, der Hypo Tirol Bank Wien, ermöglichten Buffett laben und mit den vielen neuen Club-Mitgliedern ordentlich ""netzwerken"".

In der begeisterten Gästeschar wurden u.a. gesehen: BM Margarete Schramböck, Schauspieler Martin Leutgeb, Helmut Tomac (Generalsekretär Innenministerium), Club Tirol Vizepräsidentin Renate Danler (Renate Danler Consulting) die CLUB TIROL-Vorstandsmitglieder Charlotte Sengthaler (e&k public relations), Peter Kunz (Kunz Wallentin RAE), Barbara Kolm (Vizepräsidentin der OeNB), Martina Scheiber (HR-SCOPE) Herbert Rieser (cafe+co) und Stefan Kirchebner (Oberst der Garde), Anton Luchner (SOBI), Gabi Krieger-Wolf (Artist Backoffice), Sebastian Krieger (Sänger), Klaus Brandhofer (Antirisk), Josef Franz Winkler (Salon Hair Couture), Katrin Sturm (Künstlerin), Christian Hagen (ÖBB), Elisabeth Marschang (BMEIA), Karin Mayr (Observer), Isabelle Roche (SHEconomy), Manfred Majorkovits (Pentalog), Max Unterrainer (Wiener Wohnen Michaela Reith (Sommertheater Kitzbühel) Thomas Seeber (Kunz Wallentin RAE), Peter Wahler (Prater Alm), Valentin Winkler (Muhr Immobilien), Sanja und Herfried Weiß (Daheim leben Seniorenbetreuung) Johannes Ausserladscheiter (European Experts), Reinhard Heiserer (Jugend eine Welt), Christian Jäger und Mario Zanger (Hypo Tirol Bank) Gabi Pröll (Hagelversicherung), Thomas Reisenzahn (Prodinger Tourismusberatung), Gernot Maurer (Constantin Film) Christian Schölnhammer (braind+) u.v.m.

Home Entertainment and DC announced the March 24 Digital release, and April 7 VOD release, of Birds of Prey and the Fabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn. Directed by Cathy Yan (Dead Pigs) from a script by Christina Hodson (Bumblebee), the film is based on characters from DC.

Margot Robbie (Bombshell, Once Upon a Time in…Hollywood, I, Tonya) reprises her role as the endearingly daring ne’er-do-well Harley Quinn. The main cast also includes Mary Elizabeth Winstead (10 Cloverfield Lane, TV’s Fargo) as Huntress, Jurnee Smollett-Bell (True Blood) as Black Canary, Rosie Perez (Fearless, Pitch Perfect 2) as Renee Montoya, Chris Messina (Argo, Sharp Objects) as Victor Zsasz, and Ewan McGregor (Doctor Sleep, Trainspotting) as DC Super-Villain Roman Sionis/Black Mask. Newcomer Ella Jay Basco also stars as Cassandra “Cass” Cain in her feature film debut.

Birds of Prey and the Fabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn was produced by Robbie, Bryan Unkeless and Sue Kroll. Walter Hamada, Galen Vaisman, Geoff Johns, Hans Ritter and David Ayer served as executive producers.

The creative team, led by Yan, included director of photography Matthew Libatique (A Star Is Born, Venom), production designer K.K. Barrett (Her), editors Jay Cassidy (American Hustle, Silver Linings Playbook) and Evan Schiff (John Wick Chapters 2 & 3) and costume designer Erin Benach (A Star Is Born). The music is by Daniel Pemberton (Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse).

In the film, when Gotham’s most nefariously narcissistic villain, Roman Sionis (Ewan McGregor), and his zealous right-hand, Zsasz (Chris Messina), put a target on a young girl named Cass (Ella Jay Basco), the city is turned upside down looking for her. Harley (Margot Robbie), Huntress (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), Black Canary (Jurnee Smollett-Bell) and Renee Montoya’s (Rosie Perez) paths collide, and the unlikely foursome have no choice but to team up to take Roman down.

No differences on portfolio allocation: Jayant Patil

MUMBAI: Amid murmurs of resentment over distribution of ministries between alliance partners Shiv Sena, the Congress and the NCP in Maharashtra, leaders of the three parties held marathon meetings on Wednesday to finalise the allocation of portfolios.The cabinet was expanded on Monday with induction of 36 ministers which took its strength to 43, including chief minister Uddhav Thackeray.The leaders held several rounds of talks with Uddhav Thackeray during the day, sources said.""Allocation of ministries has been almost finalized. All issues have been resolved. The allocation is expected to be announced by tomorrow,"" a source said.District guardian ministers and sitting arrangement of ministers at cabinet meetings were finalised on Wednesday, they said.Ashok Chavan, Balasaheb Thorat, Vijay Wadettiwar and Nitin Raut from the Congress, Jayant Patil and Ajit Pawar from the NCP and Eknath Shinde from the Shiv Sena met Thackeray to discuss allocation of ministries.According to Congress sources, the party is upset that it was not given any of the ministries which have a bearing on rural areas, such as agriculture and cooperation.""We can swap portfolios with other two parties. We are not demanding increase in the number of ministries,"" sources added.All three parties are facing disgruntlement of leaders who were not inducted in the cabinet.Among such MLAs are Congress's Sangram Thopte, whose supporters vandalised Pune Congress office on Tuesday, and NCP's Prakash Solanke.

Über Kirche und Politik

Business CLUB TIROL im Gespräch mit dem Generalsekretär der Österreichischen Bischofskonferenz

Wien (pts005/14.02.2020/08:00) - Die ""Pummerin"" im Wiener Stephansdom ist eines der Symbole für Österreichs (katholische) Kirche. Eine Reihe von Mitgliedern des Businessclub CLUB TIROL besuchten die ""Große Glocke von St. Stephan"" am Nordturm des Domes, bevor es zum geplanten ""Gesprächstermin"" mit dem Oberhaupt der heimischen Kirche in den Räumen des benachbarten ""Club 4"" ging. Doch Kardinal Christoph Schönborn musste gesundheitlich bedingt kurzfristig absagen - und schickte als ""Ersatz-Gesprächspartner"" den Generalsekretär der Österreichischen Bischofskonferenz in die rund 60-köpfige Runde von in Wien lebenden ""Exil-Tirolern"".

""Wir bedauern zwar das Fernbleiben des Kardinals, freuen uns jedoch über den tollen Ersatz"", begrüßte CLUB-TIROL-Vizepräsidentin Renate Danler den ""waschechten"" Wiener, studierten Juristen und Theologen Peter Schipka. Dieser widmete sich in seinen Impulsvortrag dem aktuellen Thema ""Politik und Kirche"". Dabei denke man hierzulande zwar zuerst an den ""politischen Islam"", vielfach beginne die Diskussion jedoch ""beim Kopftuch und endet beim Kreuz"". Wie öffentlich darf Religion sein? Darf man erkennbar einer Religion angehören? In welchen Räumen hängen Kreuze? Dies seien alles recht schnell politische Fragen.

Die Welt mitgestalten

Äußere sich der Kardinal politisch, dann folge rasch die Reaktion: ""Die Kirche soll sich nicht einmischen."" Aber darf der Kardinal, die Kirche, keine Position beziehen? Ab wann ist es tatsächlich eine Einmischung? Fragen, die, so Schipka, eigentlich ungeklärt sind. Aus Sicht der Kirche sollen nicht zuerst die Bischöfe, sondern ""alle Christen politisch sein"". Das gehöre zum so genannten Weltdienst, die ""Welt mitzugestalten betrifft alle Gläubigen"". Die Bischofskonferenz werde erst politisch, wenn es etwa um die Begutachtung geplanter Gesetzesänderungen der Regierung gehe, wie etwa das Kopftuchverbot: ""Da äußern wir uns.""

Historisch gesehen hatte Österreichs Kirche schon ein wesentlich engeres Verhältnis zur Politik (Monarchie, Zwischenkriegszeit). Nach dem 2. Weltkrieg wurde das Verhältnis neu definiert - man wollte eine ""freie Kirche in einem freien Staat"". Dieses Verhältnis entwickelte sich weiter. Die Annahme, mit allen politischen Parteien auf gleicher Distanz zu sein, entpuppte sich als nicht möglich, da ""die einzelnen Parteien unterschiedlich ansprechbar auf kirchliche Positionen sind."" Das heißt, nicht die Kirche sondern die Parteien bestimmen, wie nahe sie zur Kirche stehen. Und die Nähe oder Entfernung einer Partei zur Kirche werde durch ""das Programm, die Praxis und Personen bestimmt."" Nur weil eine Partei das Wort christlich im Namen führt, heißt es in der Praxis nicht, dass sie der Kirche sehr nahe steht. Und umgekehrt.

Getrennte Bereiche

Wie politisch kann also eine Religion sein? Peter Schipka listet drei Bereiche auf. Zum einen gibt es zwischen Staat und Kirche getrennte Bereiche, die es zu respektieren gilt. ""Die Straßenverkehrsordnung ist keine Sache der Kirche, das ist keine Glaubensfrage."" Umgekehrt heißt es, der Staat mischt sich in die inneren Angelegenheiten der Kirche (zB. Wer darf Priester werden, wer darf heiraten) nicht ein.

Christen (wie auch Angehörige anderer Religionen) sind Staatsbürger und sind dem Staat gegenüber loyal. Was nicht ausschließt, dass ""ich den Staat mitgestalte und meine Überzeugungen einbringe."" Etwa bei der Frage nach dem ""freien Sonntag"" oder dem ""Schutz des Lebens."" Mitgestaltung aus christlicher Überzeugung bedeute aber auch, dass ""ich es respektieren muss, wenn Gesetze meine Meinung nicht wieder spiegeln."" Etwas heikel werde es, so Schipka, mit folgender religiöser Regel: ""Man muss Gott mehr gehorchen, als den Menschen."" Dies birgt den Konflikt in sich, wenn es heißt, dass ""staatliches Recht immer vorgeht."" Entwickle sich ein Land etwa zu einem Unrechtsstaat, dann sei es für einen Christen klar, dass er dabei nicht mitmacht. Wo genau die Grenzen liegen, um gegen staatliches Recht vorzugehen, lasse sich nicht exakt festlegen. Schipka: ""Würde etwa die Folter als staatliches Instrument eingeführt, dann sehe ich eine Grenze überschritten, dagegen müssten wir aufstehen.""

Rege Diskussion

Nach den Ausführungen von Peter Schipka nutzte das Publikum die Gelegenheit, eine Reihe an Fragen an ihn zu stellen. Darunter auch jene nach der Rolle der Frauen in der katholischen Kirche - wohl auch angesichts des an diesem Tag veröffentlichten päpstlichen Schreiben zur Amazonas-Synode, in der der Pontifex die Weihe von Frauen ablehnt. Schipka sieht unabhängig von der theologischen Frage dabei die Möglichkeit, das Kirchenbild umzudrehen und die Weihe nicht so sehr in den Vordergrund stellen - dann könnten auch Frauen einfacher Leitungsfunktionen einnehmen.

Spende für Projekte

Als besonderen ""Genesungswunsch"" an Kardinal Schönborn überreichte Vizepräsidentin Renate Danler zum Abschluss des Treffens an Peter Schipka eine Spende des Clubs: Für zwei ""Herzensanliegen"" des Kardinals, dem Projekt ""Open Hospitals"" in Syrien sowie dem Caritas-Projekt ""Le+O Unterstützung für Bedürftige in Österreich.""

You might spot phishing scams, where scammers try to get your Social Security number (SSN) or financial info – maybe to guarantee you access to a COVID-19 vaccine (remember: there’s still no vaccine, so definitely no access). They might say they’re from Medicare (they’re not) with a health kit, from the CDC (again, not) with a vaccine kit, or the Social Security Administration (nope), telling you there’s a problem with your SSN (there’s not). And some scammers might even still be running some of their go-to favorites: tech support, utilities, or lower-your-interest-rate scams.

4596,1597703658,"['Amy Taxin And John Antczak', 'Associated Press', 'May']",California allows three more Orange County beaches to reopen,en,,,,Gov. Newsom's administration gave approval Tuesday to plans by Huntington Beach and two smaller cities to reopen beaches that fell under his order shutting down the entire Orange County coast.,"California allows three more Orange County beaches to reopen

HUNTINGTON BEACH - California Gov. Gavin Newsom's administration gave approval Tuesday to plans by Huntington Beach and two smaller cities to reopen beaches that fell under his order shutting down the entire Orange County coast after a heat wave drew large crowds to the shore.

Huntington Beach, the world famous surfing mecca, and the cities of Dana Point and Seal Beach submitted plans consistent with the governor's orders in response to the coronavirus pandemic and include measures to avoid overcrowding and enable physical distancing, the state Natural Resources Agency said.

The action follows approval Monday of beach access plans submitted by two other cites, Laguna Beach and San Clemente, which essentially allow active use and not sunbathing.

Orange County will draft a similar plan after supervisors voted Tuesday to submit one to the state. Supervisor Lisa Bartlett said the move would let residents get fresh air and exercise without running the risk of spreading the coronavirus, which could further slow the resumption of economic activity.

“With the active recreation, it provides a high level of public health and safety,” she said. “If we have too many people in a given area and there's mass gathering, and they don't have face coverings, then potentially we're going to spread the risk of coronavirus and we're not going to be able to open up as quickly as possible.”

The move was opposed by two supervisors who argued that Newsom shouldn't have singled out the county for beach closures and that active plans don't let families with young children, or people with injures, enjoy the beach.

“No other county is required to do what this governor, in his arbitrary and capricious exercise of power, has asked us to submit to,” Supervisor Don Wagner said during the meeting. “I am disappointed that local governments in coastal cities felt the need to bow and scrape and throw together a plan.”

The governor announced on April 30 that he was ordering all Orange County beaches to shut down after spring heat spell prompted thousands of people to head to the coast, primarily at Huntington Beach and adjacent Newport Beach.

Huntington Beach filed a lawsuit trying to get its beach reopened, but a judge refused to immediately block the order. Newport Beach supported that suit.

Newport Beach has also submitted a proposal to the state reopen its beaches and hopes to hear soon, John Pope, a city spokesman, said in a statement.

For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, and death. The vast majority of people recover.

Police confirmed that the king's spokesperson, Babalo Papu, was rescued from an alleged attack.

The latest drama comes in the midst of a war between Azenathi and his father, AbaThembu King Buyelekhaya Dalindyebo.

Babalo Papu, an advisor to AbaThembu King Buyelekhaya Dalindyebo, has approached police to open a criminal case after he was allegedly assaulted by some members of the royal family - including acting King Azenathi Dalindyebo.

Papu has accused Azenathi Dalindyebo, his mother Buyiswa Majiki and Azenathi's spokesperson, uncle and advisor, Siganeko Dalindyebo, and others of assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm (GBH).

Majiki is an Eastern Cape High Court judge and the former wife of Buyelekhaya Dalindyebo.

READ | King Dalindyebo gets backing of AbaThembu faction in royal DNA drama

Called for comment, on Thursday Majiki said: ""Indeed it came to my knowledge that a criminal case has been opened against me but I have no knowledge of these allegations or circumstances surrounding the case.""

The matter was reported to the Madeira police station in Mthatha on Wednesday evening, according to police.

It came a day after the police were called to a Maiden Farm address and rescued Papu from an alleged assault by a group of men, police spokesperson Colonel Sibongile Soci said.

On Thursday, Soci said: ""[Police] can confirm that a case of assault GBH has been opened for investigation. The complainant will be interviewed further to ascertain other information that has surfaced regarding the investigation.""

Siganeko Dalindyebo confirmed he was involved in the alleged assault, saying he found Papu talking to his wife on his premises.

I felt cornered in my own space from my own enemy. Prince Siganeko Zanothando Dalindyebo

Both Papu and Siganeko find themselves on opposite ends of the father-and-son battle for kingship. Papu acts as an advisor to Buyelekhaya and Siganeko to Azenathi.

""I, Prince Siganeko Zanothando Dalindyebo, feel I was provoked by Babalo and the people who he was conniving with and gave him my wife's cellphone number. I felt it was an attack on my integrity and manhood and to the safety of my family and those close to me, by finding my sole enemy inside my premises.""

""How naïve can he be as a person to go to a home of a person [when] he knows they don't get along, based on the Dalindyebo succession debate, communicating with my wife and entering my gate? He can't expect me to feel safe. I felt cornered in my own space from my own enemy. I felt I should protect myself and loved ones from my enemy,"" Siganeko said.

Siganeko said his wife spend most of the time alone in Mthatha. He is based 50km away at Bumbane Great Place where he serves as a traditional leader and as one of the advisors to acting king Azenathi.

Meanwhile, Soci said: ""SAPS can confirm a complaint was received yesterday at about 15:00 and police were dispatched to the scene at Maiden Farm. Upon arrival, they found a visibly assaulted man and intervened by removing the injured person from immediate danger and also ensured that his vehicle was removed from the premises.""

Soci earlier said Papu had been advised to open cases of assault, crimen injuria and malicious damage to property against the ""people who assaulted him and damaged his vehicle"".

Contacted for comment, Papu responded with a short statement he had posted on his Facebook page on Tuesday night: ""I am in good shape, I cannot go into details or merits of this matter as advised by my legal counsel.

""I can only confirm that I was brutally attacked by Sganeko, Azenathi, Azenathi's body guard, [whose name was withheld] and one more guy I still need to find his name (sic).

""This is all I can say, thank you very much nge calls, sms, What'sApp shows that I am not alone (sic).

""Thank you and goodnight to all. Babalo Batembu Papu.""

News24 tried several times to get comment from Azenathi for his side of the story. Attempts included several phone calls and text messages to him since Tuesday. His phone was off and his spokesperson, Siganeko, declined to speak on his behalf, saying the acting king should speak for himself.

Father-and-son war

The latest drama came a day after AbaThembu King Buyelekhaya Dalindyebo appeared in the Mthatha Magistrate's Court for assault. He disowned Azenathi and his claim to the throne, demanding a paternity test.

The assault case was opened by Azenathi on 13 March after Dalindyebo allegedly trespassed on the Bumbane Great Place palace, outside Mthatha, and allegedly used an axe to attack Azenathi at around 03:00.

National Prosecuting Authority spokesperson Luxolo Tyali said the case was postponed to 7 December for further investigation.

Buyelekhaya Dalindyebo is currently staying at Nkululekweni residence in Mthatha, following his early release from prison in December. He only served four years of his 12-year sentence when President Cyril Ramaphosa granted him special remission parole as part of a larger category of offenders.

He had been sent to jail in 2015 for arson, kidnapping, assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm and defeating the ends of justice. He was found guilty of terrorising his subjects in the 1990s.

The father-and-son war dates to 2016 when Azenathi went against his incarcerated father's advice and ascended to the throne.

The king wanted his wife to act on his behalf and had written a series of prison letters advising the then University of Free State student, Azenathi, to focus on his studies.",https://www.news24.com/news24/SouthAfrica/News/abathembu-royal-family-members-accused-of-assaulting-kings-advisor-20200604,,,"['Western Cape', 'Mpumalanga', 'Free State', 'KwaZulu-Natal', 'Gauteng', 'Eastern Cape', 'Limpopo']"

Scoot had said early on Friday (Jan 31) that it would suspend flights to 11 cities and reduce flights to eight other cities, but had stepped up its precautionary measures in line with those announced by the Government later in the day.

Measures that the authorities announced to limit the spread of the Wuhan virus include the barring of all travellers arriving from mainland China who had been there in the past 14 days from entry or transit in Singapore.

Scoot currently operates 100 weekly flights to 18 points in China, excluding Wuhan.

It said that before Feb 8, some flights to China, such as those to Guangzhou and Qingdao, will be operating on reduced frequencies before the suspension kicks in till late March.

Between Feb 2 and Feb 7, the flights operating to and from China will have limited in-flight services with no sales of food and beverage items.

All customers will be provided with a food pack, including water.

Customers booked on flights affected by the schedule change will receive a refund, said Scoot.

The operator added: ""Scoot will continue to closely monitor the coronavirus situation as the health and safety of our passengers and employees are our highest priority.

""For now, Scoot flights between Singapore and all mainland China destinations after the above-stated suspension period will continue to operate as scheduled.""

Scoot is a member of the Singapore Airlines Group, which also includes Singapore Airlines and SilkAir.

The two latter carriers also announced earlier on Friday that it will reduce the number of flights to mainland China in February, subject to regulatory approvals.

In a Facebook post on Friday, SIA said that the airline as well as SilkAir would be cancelling some flights between Singapore and cities including Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Xiamen, Chengdu and Chongqing.

The Chronicle reports that Banda succumbed to the injuries upon admission to Siabuwa clinic. The publication also reports that the duo had a dispute at Sengwa Fishing Camp in Binga.

Ngwenya who is now facing a murder charge in connection with Banda’s death has since approached the High Court seeking bail pending trial.

The State, however, opposed the bail application arguing that there was no guarantee that Ngwenya would not abscond once released on bail. Representing the State, Ms Nokuthaba Ngwenya said:

The applicant is said to be from Gokwe and had visited Binga on fishing expedition and police are still making efforts to confirm his village of origin. It would, therefore, be risky to release him on bail because there is a likelihood of absconding.

She added that there was overwhelming evidence against the accused and the investigations have been completed hence releasing him would not serve justice.

The amount of money which te duo was fighting for is not known.

4747,1581458860,['Aaron Colen'],California county's antibody study suggests 50-80 times more cases than official tally,en,,,,It creates a 'difficult choice' about how to reopen the country,"The results of an antibody test study including thousands of residents in California's Santa Clara County suggests that there have been tens of thousands more COVID-19 infections in the county than officially reported, according to ABC News.

What the study found: The study tested 3,300 residents of Santa Clara County and found that between 2.5% and 4% of them tested positive for COVID-19 antibodies, indicating that they had been infected in the past and had possibly developed immunity.



From that result, researchers estimated that between 48,000 and 81,000 people in the county (population 2 million) have already gotten COVID-19. Currently, the county has officially recorded approximately 1,000 cases.

What this could mean: This is just the latest data providing evidence that the coronavirus has spread far more broadly than we are able to confirm through COVID-19 tests, which are still scarce and typically only administered to those who are exhibiting symptoms.

""Our findings suggest that there is somewhere between 50- and 80-fold more infections in our county than what's known by the number of cases than are reported by our department of public health,"" Dr. Eran Bendavid, the associate professor of medicine at Stanford University who led the study, told ABC News' Diane Sawyer.



Other considerations: With this study, it's important to note that the use of online ads to recruit participants in the study could have skewed the sample some.



It's also not clear what level of immunity people with the antibodies have, and how long it might last. Assuming the antibodies provide some level of immunity, however, this study also indicates that potentially 95% of the country has not been exposed to the virus and therefore has no immunity.

As states prepare to gradually ease social distancing mandates and allow public life to resume normally, a lack of immunity in the population creates a possibility of coronavirus outbreaks once people start gathering again.

""[W]hat that means for things like, are we going to wait for people to get infected to get antibodies in order for them to get back to work ... knowing that well upwards of 90% of the population doesn't have antibodies is going to make that a very difficult choice,"" Bendavid told ABC News.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/new-stanford-antibody-study-suggests-50-80-times-more-cases-than-official-tally,,,"['Government', 'Media', 'Economy', 'Politics', 'Sports', 'World', 'Law', 'Crime', 'Business', 'Faith', 'Science', 'Books', 'NSA', 'Education', 'Guns', 'Terrorism', 'Immigration', 'Lifestyle', 'Military', 'Disasters', 'US', 'Entertainment', 'Environment', 'Campus', 'Technology', 'Election', 'Health']"
4783,1483936561,['Author Profile'],Joker: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack by Hildur Guðnadóttir (film soundtrack review).,en,,,,,"302.9k SHARES Share Tweet

While ‘Joker: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack’ is billed as the original motion picture soundtrack, you need to be aware of what your buying here. It is the musical score of the movie composed by Hildur Guðnadóttir and does not include the many other songs played in the movie. You will have to go looking elsewhere for those.

Now that we have covered what the CD is not, let’s talk about what it actually is. Guðnadóttir has opted for a classical style orchestra for this soundtrack, although there are occasionally some sound effects thrown in amongst the traditional strings, percussion and woodwind instruments. The accompanying material says that the composition ‘features the cello as the centerpiece of the score, leading string-based melodies played by a symphony orchestra of 90 musicians’.

As you can see from the track listing below most tracks are quite short. The two longest tracks are probably pivotal moments in the film and possibly Joker’s life.

1 Hoyt’s Office 01:24

2 Defeated Clown 02:39

3 Following Sophie 01:33

4 Penny in the Hospital 01:18

5 Young Penny 02:01

6 Meeting Bruce Wayne 04:35

7 Hiding in the Fridge 01:23

8 A Bad Comedian 01:28

9 Arthur Comes to Sophie 01:39

10 Looking for Answers 00:51

11 Penny Taken to the Hospital 01:49

12 Subway 03:33

13 Bathroom Dance 02:08

14 Learning How to Act Normal 01:17

15 Confession 01:29

16 Escape from the Train 02:31

17 Call Me Joker 04:48

All told we have 17 tracks giving a running time of only 37 minutes which seems a little short to me.

I should have said that the tone of the score is somewhere between sombre, melancholy and ominous depending on which track your listening to. One of the things you can’t say about it is ‘it’s a jolly little tune’. I have to say though that I thought it was very well done given the subject matter of the film.

That last sentence brings me to point out that to get the very best out of this soundtrack you really need to see the film. It will give you goosebumps. The ‘Subway’ track always makes me nervous. Perhaps that’s why the CD is short on running time, any longer could lead to a breakdown.

This is the first of Hildur Guðnadóttir’s work that I have actually listened to and I am very impressed. For any fan of the film who is not of a nervous disposition, then you really should treat yourself and get a copy. You can get the CD or Vinyl picture disc or even a coloured vinyl configuration whatever that is.

4847,1606591761,['Babatunde Abdulfatah'],Human Traffickers Intercepted In Finland ⋆,en,,,,"Members of an international criminal group, smuggling people from mainland Europe to the UK, had been intercepted at Finland","Get real time updates directly on you device, subscribe now.

Members of an international criminal group, smuggling people from mainland Europe to the United Kingdom, had been intercepted at Helsinki-Vantaa International Airport, the Finnish Border Guard said on Thursday.

The human traffickers were identified when a Swedish citizen and a Kuwaiti, who had used another person’s Swedish passport, were arrested at the airport in January.

The two men were on their way from Paris via Helsinki to London, the Border Guard said.

According to a preliminary investigation launched by the Crime Prevention Unit of the Gulf of Finland Coast Guard District, it was not the Swedish man’s first such journey to Finland.

Between December 2019 and January 2020, he is suspected to have smuggled two other foreigners from Finland to the UK by using other people’s passports.

The investigation has also found that the Swedish citizen caught in Finland had applied for asylum in the UK as a Kuwaiti by providing false personal information to the local authorities.

The criminal offences under investigation in Finland are part of a series of operations, in which people have been smuggled from mainland Europe through various countries to the UK, the Border Guard said.

The acts are suspected to have been carried out by an influential professional smuggling ring in Sweden and the UK.

The criminal gang is suspected of having charged the trafficked persons around 8,000 euros ($8,600) for each trip.

During the investigation, close international cooperation was established with the support of Europol (the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation) and Eurojust (a European Union agency dealing with judicial cooperation in criminal matters).

Members of the smuggling ring have been caught in both Sweden and the UK, where local authorities conducted home searches and arrests.

A suspect in Finland, the Swedish citizen has been imprisoned since the end of January 2020 on suspicion of organising a serious illegal entry.

The investigation into the other members of the criminal ring continues in Finland and abroad, the Border Guard said.

It’d be nice if we could do all that without a horrible, head-wracking hangover.

Before you start scheduling hangover recovery time on your holiday calendar, know there are things you can do to make that bottle-ache a bit milder. And that’s the best-case scenario, because we’re sorry to tell you one cold, hard fact: there is no cure for hangovers. Like, none. Zero.

What do you mean there’s no cure for hangovers?

Exactly that, actually. For starters, science still doesn’t quite know what causes a hangover. Literature on the subject has identified three possible culprits: the direct effect of alcohol on the brain and other organs, the effects of alcohol withdrawal from these organs; and other non-alcoholic factors, such as the physiological effects of compounds created when the body processes alcohol, like methanol.

It’s also challenging to define what a hangover is. The definition researchers generally agree upon is that it’s a condition characterized by a feeling of misery that can last up to 24 hours after the amount of alcohol in your blood drops to zero. As anyone who’s ever experienced a hangover will tell you, symptoms can vary both in nature and intensity, going from headache, nausea, and fatigue, to muscle aches, vomiting, lack of concentration, and anxiety.

The symptoms you experience after a night of drinking will depend on multiple factors, like how much you drank, for how long, what it was, if you ate, what kind of food you devoured, if you danced, or smoked, and more. And that’s not even taking into account genetic predisposition to hangovers or family history regarding alcohol addiction.

Considering these effects vary widely from person to person—and even from one hangover to another—it is very hard to study them, which makes hangovers a tough nut to crack. And then there’s the morality of curing them.

“A possible explanation for the lack of scientific interest is that many physicians and researchers regard the alcohol hangover as an adequate punishment for unwanted behavior,” Utrecht University researchers Joris C. Verster and Renske Penning wrote in their 2010 paper Treatment and Prevention of Alcohol Hangover.

According to them, it is possible that part of the scientific community may not want to find a cure for hangovers because doing so would make binge drinking that much easier.

Ok, so how do I deal with a hangover?

Since we don’t know what causes hangovers, there’s no drug or homemade remedy that will get rid of one entirely. In fact, the only scientifically proven method to avoid a hangover is moderate alcohol consumption or good old abstinence.

But since it is likely you will eventually have to deal with at least one hangover, it’s a good idea to know there are things you can do to make the day after a party a little less miserable.

Rehydrate

Dehydration is one of the main symptoms of hangovers. Alcohol inhibits the production of antidiuretic hormone, preventing the kidneys from reabsorbing water and resulting in the overproduction of urine. Add that to sweating, vomiting, or diarrhea (all possible hangover symptoms), and you end up with a sure case of dehydration.

Drinking one glass of water for every alcoholic beverage you consume is a great way to prevent a bad hangover. If that ship has already sailed and you’re experiencing hangover-induced dehydration, you can always opt for a sports drink or make your own oral rehydration salts. All you need to do is mix two tablespoons of sugar and a 3/4 teaspoon of salt in four cups of water. Doing so will not only help you get that precious water back into your body, but will also restore your electrolytes.

Beware of congeners

If you’ve ever experienced a red wine-induced hangover, you know they’re some of the worst you can get, and congeners are to blame. These are the biologically active compounds that give alcoholic beverages their distinct taste, smell, and color. Research shows a higher concentration of congeners may have something to do with more severe hangovers, whereas drinking distilled spirits containing purer ethanol, such as vodka or gin, will result in milder or fewer hangover effects.

When it comes to avoiding hangovers, the lighter the color, the better—stay away from rum, whiskey, tequila and red wine, which are among the alcoholic drinks with higher amounts of congeners.

Sleep well

Fatigue and muscle aches are two of the most common hangover symptoms, and you don’t have to be a doctor to know the best way to treat them: rest. But alcohol consumption disrupts sleep patterns, resulting in both less and worse sleep. Drinking also alters your circadian rhythm, which raises cortisol levels and causes a feeling similar to jet lag.

It might be difficult, but a good way to combat a hangover is just to sleep. Give yourself the time to get some rest and bounce back. And if you made the horrible decision of making plans for early the next day, God help you.

Be careful when taking Aspirin or paracetamol

When you’re suffering from a hangover that features an intense headache, your first instinct may be to take Aspirin or paracetamol. Studies have shown alcohol can cause an inflammatory response in the body, so anti-inflammatory drugs such as these could have a positive effect.",https://www.popsci.com/story/diy/cure-hangover/,,,

North Marion freshman finished fifth nationally in the Junior World Finals pole bending competitions held in Las Vegas

North Marion High School freshman Payton Johnson notched her name at a national level, placing fifth in the 17-and-under pole bending category at the Junior World Finals held in Las Vegas Dec. 9-14.

Johnson's three successive rides clocked 21.628, 21.522 and 20.475 for a 63.971 final. The first two qualified Johnson for the finale.

""The first two rounds are where everybody gets to go,"" Johnson said of the field of roughly 40 riders. ""Then the top 10 in the average get to go in the short round.""

Johnson stood at No. 6 going into the short round before improving with her final ride.

Cassidy Evans of Yuma, Colo., took the top spot at 60.383 (20.655, 19.775 and 19.953).

Johnson, who lives in the Broadacres area, said she was happy with her performance in Las Vegas, and she looks forward to more competitions in the future.

""I think for my first time, it was pretty good,"" she said

But perhaps the most enjoyable part of the adventure was meeting people from all over the country.

""I got to meet a lot of different people from all kinds of places,"" Johnson said. ""There were some super-nice people from Mississippi, and pretty cool people from Texas. I met people from Pennsylvania and California. That was a lot of fun.""

Johnson, who turns 15 this month, is a member of the Oregon High School Rodeo where she competes as an all-around cowgirl in barrel racing, pole bending, team roping, breakaway roping and goat tying. She qualified for the Junior World Finals earlier in the year at a national rodeo held in Red Bluff, Calif.

The 20-yer-old, Evans Ngwenya allegedly struck Paul Banda twice with a log and struck his skull following a dispute at Sengwa Fishing Camp in Binga.

Banda succumbed to the injuries upon admission to Siabuwa clinic.

Ngwenya was ccharged with murder and has since approached the High Court seeking bail pending trial.

In his bail application, Ngwenya offered to pay $200 bail and to continue residing at his given address until the case has been finalized.

He also offered to surrender his canoe as surety.

The State opposed the bail application, arguing that there was no guarantee that the accused person wouldn’t flee if given bail

“The applicant is said to be from Gokwe and had visited Binga on fishing expedition and police are still making efforts to confirm his village of origin. It would therefore be risky to release him on bail because there is a likelihood of absconding,” said Ms Ngwenya.

According to court papers, Ngwenya and Banda went on a fishing expedition at Sengwa Fishing Camp in Binga district where they had an altercation after arguing on the fish sale profits.

During their fight, Ngwenya picked a log and struck Banda twice on the head.

He sustained head injuries and he was taken to Siabuwa Clinic the following day where he succumbed to the injuries.

A report was made at the police leading to Ngwenya’s arrest.

According to the post mortem report the cause of death was skull fracture and assault.

Submariners conducting missions at sea are likely among the last people in the world learning about the coronavirus pandemic turning life upside down back home.

Current and former officers who served aboard France's nuclear-armed subs say mariners aboard ballistic submarines are routinely spared bad news while underwater to encourage undivided focus on their top-secret missions and to avoid undermining their morale.

Any crews that left port before the virus spread around the globe are likely being kept in the dark about the extent of the rapidly unfurling crisis until their return.

""All events that could affect or change the morale of the crew members are kept from them,"" said Chief Doctor Gabriel. (He spoke to The Associated Press on condition that he be identified only by his first name and rank, in accordance with the rules of his branch of the French military.) ""Since there is no Internet, no radio and no television on board, the only news you get comes from messages received by the commander, and the commander filters the messages to not give all of the information to everyone.""

Four French ballistic submarines, laden with 16 missiles can each carry six nuclear warheads, left harbor before France instituted a nationwide lockdown on March 17.

Adm. Dominique Salles, who commanded the nuclear-armed French submarine ""L'Inflexible,"" told the AP he believes submariners will likely only be told of the pandemic as they head back to port, in the final two days of their mission.

""They won't know,"" Salles said. ""The boys need to be completely available for their mission.""

French submarine missions last 60 to 70 days, with about 110 crew members aboard. A crew that left at the end of February wouldn't be expected back before the end of April. In that case, they will return to a world changed by the pandemic.

On March 1, France had just 130 confirmed COVID-19 cases and two deaths. In under a month, those numbers have surged to over 40,000 sickened and 2,600 dead. For submariners, the return to land will likely be a shock.

Salles said the situation now will be toughest for any crews that leave harbor in the weeks ahead, because they'll know they are leaving loved ones in the midst of the pandemic and, possibly, still living in lockdown. The French government has already extended its stay-home orders once, to April 15, and said it could do so again.

Salles said he believes those crews will get regular coronavirus updates but won't be told of any family deaths until they are returning to the l'Ile Longue submarine base near Brest in Brittany.

4986,1563474563,,Public health officer says social distancing may be working in King County,en,,,,,"



SEATTLE -- Public health officials and researchers say social distancing appears to be helping slow the spread of COVID-19 in the Seattle area, where many of the first U.S. deaths occurred.

Dr. Jeff Duchin, the public health officer for Seattle and King County, said Monday a new analysis by the Bellevue-based Institute of Disease Modeling provides a powerful indication that the region needs to double-down on the policies it’s already adopted.

“What we’re doing now appears to be working,” Duchin said. “We need to continue this for weeks.”

In two papers released Monday, the Institute for Disease Modeling acknowledged that much remains unknown about rates of infection, but based on available data and a variety of assumptions, its computer models suggest that a measure of transmission — an estimate of how many people are infected by each person who is already infected — has fallen.

In late February, each person with COVID was infecting about 2.7 other people; by March 18, that number had dropped to 1.4, the researchers found.

They cautioned that the numbers were rough estimates. Duchin said he felt confident saying the rate of transmission is lower than it was, but he wouldn’t put much stock in the precise figure.

To see a drop in the number of new cases, the measure of transmission would have to be below 1.

There are now more than 4,850 confirmed COVID-19 cases in Washington state and at least 195 deaths, as of Sunday, March 29.

For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in several weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death.",https://q13fox.com/2020/03/30/public-health-officer-says-social-distancing-may-be-working-in-king-county/,,,"['Economy', 'World', 'Consumer', 'COVID-19 and the Economy', 'Savings', 'Vaccine Info', 'More Coronavirus News', 'Survive the Sound', 'Sounders', 'OL Reign', 'Personal Finance', 'Healthier Together', 'Huskies', 'Kraken', 'Gas Prices', ""Scott's Weather Blog"", 'Commentary', 'Mariners', 'Omicron Variant', 'Regional News', 'Storm', 'Seahawks', 'Latest from Around the World', 'Entertainment', 'Cougars', 'Environment', 'Driver on the Street', 'Business', 'Health', 'Coronavirus']"

فخلافا للموقف السياسي الذي تتجه القيادة الفلسطينية لتنفيذه، ويشمل البدء بالتحلل من تطبيق ما على الفلسطينيين من التزامات وردت في اتفاقيات السلام الموقعة مع إسرائيل، سواء السياسية أو الاقتصادية أو الأمنية، بدا واضحا من تصريحات قيادات كبيرة في السلطة الفلسطينية أن التلويح بخيار الغضب الشعبي، وربما الذهاب إلى انتفاضة جديدة، سيكون السلاح الأقوى في مواجهة التحديات الإسرائيلية التي تدمر كل مقومات الدولة الفلسطينية، في حال طبقت خطة الضم.

وخلال الاجتماع المقرر للقيادة الفلسطينية ليل الثلاثاء، ستقر الآلية الجديدة للمواجهة، والتي وضعت بناء على قرارات لجنة مشكلة من أعضاء اللجنتين التنفيذية والمركزية، وستكون مستوحاة من الخطوط العريضة التي أعلنها الرئيس محمود عباس قبل أيام، وأكد خلالها أن القيادة ستعيد النظرَ في موقفِها من كلِ الاتفاقاتِ والتفاهمات، سواء معَ دولة الاحتلالِ الإسرائيلي، أو معَ الولاياتِ المتحدةِ الأمريكيةِ نفسِها، “وسنكون في حِلّ من كلِ تلكِ الاتفاقاتِ والتفاهماتِ إذا أعلنتْ الحكومة الإسرائيلية عن ضمِ أيِ جزءِ منْ أراضينا المحتلة، وسنحمّل الحكومتينِ الأمريكيةَ والإسرائيليةَ كلَ ما يترتب على ذلكِ من آثارٍ أو تداعياتٍ خطيرة”، حيث ستقر القيادة طريقة تنفيذ تلك التهديدات، التي سيكون لها ارتدادات بشكل مباشر على الوضع الميداني بالدرجة الأولى، والذي يشهد سخونة كبيرة.

وقبيل الاجتماع الموسع للقيادة، بعث اشتية عدة رسائل، من بينها ما وجهه عبر منصة الأمم المتحدة، حيث قال في كلمته خلال ندوة للجنة الأمم المتحدة المعنية بممارسة الشعب الفلسطيني لحقوقه غير القابلة للتصرف، الإثنين، عبر تقنية “الفيديو كونفرنس”، إن “القيادة الفلسطينية والعالم الآن أمام لحظة حقيقة في مواجهة مخططات الضم الإسرائيلية، وإن تشريع الضم في الكنيست الإسرائيلي لا يعطي أي شرعية له”.

وقد دعا اشتية العالم لعدم انتظار إسرائيل لتنفيذ قرار الضم، وطالب المجتمع الدولي باتخاذ إجراءات لمواجهته “من خلال فرض عقوبات على إسرائيل والاعتراف بالدولة الفلسطينية على حدود 1967 وعاصمتها القدس”، مشددا على أن إسرائيل خرقت كافة الاتفاقيات الموقعة، وقال إن القيادة لن تشكل لجانا أو تناقش الخطوة الإسرائيلية، وإنما ستخرج بقرارات لمواجهة ذلك، مؤكدا في ذات الوقت أن السلطة الفلسطينية “ليست هبة أو هدية من أحد”، مضيفا: “إنما جاءت نتيجة نضالات وتضحيات أبناء شعبنا، ولن نسمح لإسرائيل بهدمها أو سرقتها، فنحن نريد التحول من سلطة حكم ذاتي إلى إقامة دولتنا المستقلة على حدود عام 1967 وعاصمتها القدس”.

اشتية خلال كلمته عبر المنصة الدولية، اتهم إسرائيل بأنها تريد القضاء على أية فرصة لإقامة الدولة الفلسطينية المتواصلة جغرافيا، لا سيما من خلال مصادرة الأراضي وعزل القدس عن محيطها واستمرار فرض الحصار على قطاع غزة”، مؤكدا أيضا أن خطة “صفقة القرن” التي طرحها الرئيس الأمريكي دونالد ترامب، لا تلبي الحد الأدنى من حقوق الشعب الفلسطيني، داعيا الأمم المتحدة التي أصدرت العديد من القرارات بخصوص فلسطين ولم تطبق حتى الآن، بتطبيق تلك القرارات وتوفير الحماية الدولية للشعب وحماية “حل الدولتين” من التلاشي.

وقبل ذلك، حذر اشتية مما وصفه بـ “صيف ساخن” قد يواجه القضية الفلسطينية، في ضوء ما تعتزم الحكومة الإسرائيلية الجديدة برئاسة “بنيامين نتنياهو وبيني غانتس” تنفيذه من خطط وإجراءات لضم المستوطنات ومنطقة الأغوار وشمال البحر الميت، وجاء ذلك في بيان صدر عقب الاجتماع الأسبوعي للحكومة، أنذر فيه من “الارتدادات الخطيرة” التي قد تترتب على تنفيذ تلك الخطط التي قال إن من شأنها أن تقوض أسس السلام في المنطقة.

وبما يشير إلى عدم إغفال الدور الجماهيري الغاضب في التصدي لمخطط الضم، أعلنت اللجنة المركزية لحركة فتح أنها درست خلال اجتماع عقدته تفاصيل وكيفية الرد الفلسطيني، الذي سيتم اعتماده في اجتماع القيادة الفلسطينية، ودعت المواطنين في كل مكان، إلى “التأهب والاستنفار لمواجهة الاستحقاقات المقبلة”.

ومن المقرر أن تعقد اللجنة اجتماعا آخر لها الخميس المقبل، وقال نائب رئيس حركة فتح، محمود العالول، إن الاجتماع الأول جرى خلاله التركيز على أهمية استنفار طاقات الشعب واستنفار الحركة وكل أطرها لمواجهة التحديات الراهنة.

وسبق لمسؤولين في منظمة التحرير دعوة الدول العربية إلى الالتزام بمبادرة السلام العربية وعدم التطبيع مع إسرائيل، كما طالبوا كلا من الأردن ومصر بإلغاء العمل بالاتفاقيات مع إسرائيل في حال إقدامها على ضم أراض فلسطينية ووقف كل العلاقات معها.

ودعا لوقف كافة أشكال العلاقات مع الإدارة الأمريكية، كما دعا جميع الفصائل الفلسطينية والمؤسسات الرسمية والأهلية والمواطنين للتصدي بكل أشكال “المقاومة الشعبية” للإجراءات الإسرائيلية التي تستهدف ضم الأراضي الفلسطينية لدولة الاحتلال الإسرائيلي.

جدير ذكره أن الفلسطينيين استعانوا بالغضب الشعبي كثيرا لصد مخططات الاحتلال، واتهمت قيادة السلطة الفلسطينية في مرات سابقة من قبل الاحتلال بتسهيل نزول المواطنين في مواجهات شعبية حامية الوطيس على نقاط التماس، وهي مواجهات كان يتخللها ارتفاع وتيرة المواجهة، لتصل إلى قيام شبان بتنفيذ عمليات فردية شملت الطعن والدهس لجنود الاحتلال.

وكانت أولى تلك المواجهات التي شهدت دعما من السلطة، ما عرفت باسم “هبة النفق” عام 1996، أي مع بدايات تأسيس السلطة الفلسطينية، حين أقدم الاحتلال على فتح أنفاق أسفل المسجد الأقصى، فخرج المواطنون في مواجهات حامية أسفرت عن وقوع عشرات الشهداء، كما سجل قتلى في صفوف الجيش الإسرائيلي، خلال تبادل لإطلاق النار مع الفلسطينيين.

وفي العام 2000، اندلعت “انتفاضة الأقصى” التي دامت لخمس سنوات، وانفجرت بعد فشل محادثات السلام في “كامب ديفيد 2″، بسبب التعنت الإسرائيلي، ورفض الاحتلال منح الفلسطينيين السيادة على الأقصى، وعلى كامل المناطق المحتلة عام 1967، وتلا ذلك أن انفجرت “انتفاضة القدس” في العام 2015، رفضا لإجراءات الاحتلال ضد المدينة المحتلة، والتي بدأت بتنفيذ عمليات طعن لجنود الاحتلال، وخرج الفلسطينيون في مواجهات شعبية حامية الوطيس على كل نقاط التماس عقب الإعلان الأمريكي في نهايات يناير الماضي عن بنود “صفقة القرن”، وقبل ذلك كله، مثل تفجير الفلسطينيين في الضفة الغربية وقطاع غزة في العام 1987 “انتفاضة الحجارة”، أولى شرارات الغضب الشعبي الواسعة، لإفشال مخططات الاحتلال لتصفية القضية الفلسطينية.",https://web.archive.org/web/20210320145507id_/https://www.alquds.co.uk/%d8%a7%d8%b4%d8%aa%d9%8a%d8%a9-%d8%a3%d9%86%d8%b0%d8%b1-%d8%a8%d9%80-%d8%b5%d9%8a%d9%81-%d8%b3%d8%a7%d8%ad%d9%86-%d9%88%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%b9%d8%a7%d9%84%d9%88%d9%84-%d9%8a%d8%b9%d9%84%d9%86-%d8%a7/,,,"['فلسطين', 'موتجهة خط الضم', 'سلطات الاحتلال', 'رئيس الحكومة محمد اشتية']"

5037,1484010864,,Most Bahamians to miss growth benefits,en,,,,A well-known businessman yesterday voiced fears that the “overwhelming majority” of Nassau residents may not feel the benefits even with the capital’s economy poised for “a good inning” in 2020.,"By NEIL HARTNELL

Tribune Business Editor

nhartnell@tribunemedia.net

A well-known businessman yesterday voiced fears that the “overwhelming majority” of Nassau residents may not feel the benefits even with the capital’s economy poised for “a good inning” in 2020.

Sir Franklyn Wilson told Tribune Business that the increasing wealth gap between “the haves and have nots” appeared to be “off the radar” where the government was concerned, even though “fewer and fewer” Bahamians were seeing their share of national income increase.

He argued that the cruise port’s $250m transformation, together with other multi-million dollar developments such as Baha Mar’s water-based theme park, The Pointe’s completion, the Gold Wynn and Hurricane Hole projects, and continued investment by the likes of Albany would ensure New Providence’s economy enjoys “a good year” - but only at the macroeconomic level.

“I believe New Providence is poised to have a good inning,” the Arawak Homes and Sunshine Holdings chairman told this newspaper. “I think there’s a reasonable basis to think that New Providence will have a good year...

“However, you know, while I say New Providence should have a good inning, those are macroeconomic numbers. While the macroeconomic numbers may be favourable, the impact on the majority of people may not necessarily follow as the gap between the haves and have nots continues to widen.

“The pot as a whole is getting bigger, but fewer and fewer people are getting a decent share. Even when I say New Providence will have a good inning, I’m talking in macroeconomic terms which may not necessarily translate to the overwhelming majority of the population a year from now feeling any better off. The majority will not feel any better off.”

Sir Franklyn said the government seemed to have forgotten the growing income inequality, and widening gap between rich and lower income Bahamians, given that none of its public statements or speeches had ever addressed the issue.

“I have yet to hear any government minister make any statement that they see this as an issue,” he added. “I cannot think of any statement a cabinet minister has made which specifically addresses the imbalance between the haves and the have nots as a key public policy issue. This is not even on the radar of the authorities.”

Concerns over income inequality, and a widening gap between rich and poor stemming from a middle class ‘squeeze’, have been voiced periodically ever since the 2008-2009 recession. Real per capita incomes took 10 years to recover to their pre-recession levels, hitting this mark only in 2017.

Sir Franklyn, meanwhile, suggested that K Peter Turnquest, deputy prime minister, may come under pressure from his Cabinet colleagues to loosen spending and other fiscal controls in a bid to shore up the Government’s popularity just over half-way through its term in office.

Asked about the Government’s ability to avoid a further sovereign credit rating downgrade post-Dorian, he replied: “Minster Turnquest, he is really giving it a good shot. He is trying. I’m sure he will do his personal best to try and avoid it.

“I get the sense that there’s some restlessness within the Cabinet. They sense the popularity of the Government is not trending in a favourable direction, so they will push the minister of finance to do things which may not be consistent with avoiding that downgrade. I think a lot truly depends on the extent to which the Minister of Finance can be strong in the face of pressure from his own Cabinet colleagues.”

The Government previously revealed it will have to seek Parliamentary approval to borrow an extra $508m to finance post-Hurricane Dorian reconstruction, blowing out its projected 2019-2020 fiscal deficit to $677.5m from the initially projected $137m.

Its Fiscal Strategy Report also shows it borrowing a further $499m in 2020-2021, and $301.2m in 2021-2022, meaning that the Minnis administration is forecasting it will need to borrow some $1.479bn over its final three years in office and taking the national debt to nearly $9.5bn.

The likes of Standard & Poor’s (S&P) and Moody’s have effectively taken a wait-and-see approach, though, seemingly preferring to assess how The Bahamas manages the post-Dorian fall-out and whether it can restrain any unnecessary spending before moving to again narrow the deficit.

Sir Franklyn yesterday urged Mr Turnquest to follow “the Paul Adderley model” and “put country before party” in how he handles the public finances in the aftermath of the Category Five storm.

He added that it was “likely to be significant” that Mr Turnquest was finance minister, rather than the Prime Minister, which was the structure employed by all Dr Hubert Minnis’ predecessors.

“Thank God that we do not have that model where the Prime Minister is the de facto minister of finance,” Sir Franklyn told Tribune Business. “Experience has shown whether it was Pindling, Ingraham or Christie, it’s hard under that model to resist pressure to open up the purse.

“Thank God we don’t have that model today. Hopefully, the deputy prime minister has the ability on his part to say: ‘Man, let’s not look at this thing in the short run’. The late Paul Adderley increased taxes right before the 1992 general election. He had to know that what he was doing was good for the country even if it was bad for the party.

“I say to Mr Turnquest: ‘Keep in mind the Paul Adderley model’. Do the right thing. If you do the right thing for the country it may not be good for the party, but country first.”",http://tribune242.com/news/2019/dec/31/most-bahamians-miss-growth-benefits/,,,
5038,1484299664,,Leading and managing organisational change | The Guardian Nigeria News - Nigeria and World News,en,,,,"Every change begins with a leadership decision. Making the decision to institute changes is not always easy. Being prepared, planning well, and being surrounded by a good team will make that decision a lot easier.","

Every change begins with a leadership decision. Making the decision to institute changes is not always easy. Being prepared, planning well, and being surrounded by a good team will make that decision a lot easier. Begin by putting yourself in a positive frame of mind. You are likely to experience higher than normal levels of stress and knowing this beforehand will give you the ability to be prepared mentally and physically. You will be the anchorperson and foundation, and with your steady hand will guide your team through the stressful events. Be a reassuring and active force throughout the whole process.

It is impossible to prepare for every contingency, but planning for the known is a must. Add time or extra room to the schedule for the unknowns. When you encounter an unexpected event, your schedule should not be put off by much if you have built in some leeway. It will provide that buffer that gives you and your team the ability to deal with the unknowns and keep rolling with the change process

Surround yourself with people that you can delegate to and be confident in their abilities and skills. Be precise and specific with your directions as when the change process begins you will be depending on these individuals and their talents. Communicating and providing feedback are the keys to successful delegation; make sure your team understands this. If communication fails or there is not accurate feedback the chances of a success are lessened.

An issue that sometimes arises when delegating is micro managing. Keep an eye out to not micro-manage as you can quickly lose track of events and it will take time away from your main duties. Delegating is a skill that takes time as you must first learn the strengths and weakness of your team and know what tasks you can and cannot hand out. It may not be possible to always delegate, but when it can be done it will provide a great resource.

Always be available during the change process. Before the change prepare your friends and family that you may not be available for social events. Reassure your team that you are there for them and you are here to provide them with the necessary resources to lead them through the change. Stress to them that you are available and focused on keeping the communications lines open.

Always be aware of rumors, they will happen before during and after the change. Do not ignore any rumor, put out honest and clear communication as soon as possible. Reassure your team that if they hear a rumor to seek out more information from a reliable source. Remind them that spreading rumors helps no one and will cause more harm than good.

Not everyone will agree on the change. Keep in mind that these types of feelings are normal, as people generally do not enjoy change and are sometimes made nervous by it. You will likely encounter pushback and resistance by a number of team members. Provide facts and data to show why the change is happening and reassure them the need and benefits of the change. These types of individuals are best suited to be educated about the change with information.

If you are encountering an extreme case of pushback, provide them with some choices that still fall within the spectrum of the intended change. They should then feel more involved in the process and it will help alleviate the negative mindset they may be experiencing.It is vitally important to make sure that all stakeholders and employees are on board with a change.

In order to continue increasing awareness and to build desire to support the upcoming change; the change management team must reach out to the organization at large. The force field analysis, developed by German social psychologist Kurt Lewin helps a change management team to:

• Identify pros and cons of an option prior to making a decision

• Explore what is going right — and what is going wrong

• Analyse any two opposing positions.

If concerns or issues arise, then steps must be taken to ensure awareness is continually raised and that desire to support the change is increased. Strategies that can help the change management team responsively address employees’ concerns include:

• Engaging employees, providing forums for people to express their questions and concerns

• Equipping managers & supervisors to be effective change leaders and managers of resistance

• Orchestrating opportunities for advocates of the change to contact those not yet on board

• Aligning incentive and performance management systems to support the change.

Change is not exempt from Murphy’s Law. And even if something isn’t going wrong, change management team members must constantly be observing, listening, and evaluating the progress and process during a change. Below are several tools to help the team accomplish this.

A feedback form is used to gather information from those involved in a change to help shape the remaining course of the change project. Instead of a paper form, feedback can be obtained through online surveys (Zoomerang.com or Survey Monkey.com), an in-house questionnaire on the intranet, a few questions sent by email, or a focus group. The questions will vary depending upon the subject being queried.

Open Feedback include asking participants for suggestions and comments. The compiled results of the feedback forms can be used by the change management team members to modify the project plan and/or the communication plan or to work with specific individuals or groups that may be providing roadblocks to success.

Once a change initiative is underway, it is critical to sustain the change with reinforcement. The leader must make sure that the project and communication plan remain on track. They need to identify, and explore any issues from employees or stakeholders that have emerged, and review and consider any feedback gathered to date.

Acting as a facilitator, the leader helps to bring about learning and productivity. Communication will be a byproduct of this by providing indirect or unobtrusive assistance, guidance, and supervision.He or she listens actively, asks questions, encourages diverse viewpoints, organizes information, helps the group reach consensus, and understands that the individual needs of team members will affect teamwork.

The LEAD model provides a simple methodology for facilitating a participative meeting:

• Lead with objectives: When clear objectives are stated up front, group energy is channeled toward achieving an outcome. The objectives shape the content of the meeting.

• Empower to participate: In the Lead model, the facilitator is empowered to encourage active participation.

• Aim for consensus: Getting the team to consensus will have members more likely to support and carry out the decisions of the team.

• Direct the process: How the meeting progresses will influence the quality of the decisions of the team, and influences the commitment of team members.

Leaders must differentiate between process and content. Content includes the topics, subjects, or issues; process is about how the topics, subjects, or issues are addressed.

Because communications from managers and supervisors have been shown to have a significant impact on employees during a change initiative, it is appropriate that they be actively involved in celebrating success with employees as a result of positive performance. Celebrations can occur on three levels:

1. One on one conversation: In a private meeting, a supervisor should attest to the fact that due to the employee’s effort, a change was made, and how it is succeeding. He or she should extend verbal thanks to the employee.

2. Public recognition: Public recognition officially acknowledges outstanding performance and points out a role model that helped make a successful change happen. Supervisors should carefully consider who receives recognition, and not alienate group members who participated in the change but who many not have distinguished themselves as significantly.

3. Group celebrations: Fun or engaging activities are used to celebrate key milestones by a group. They include buffet or restaurant lunches, dinner events, or can include group outings to sports, amusement, or cultural events. It is important that these types of celebrations try to include the involvement of the primary change sponsor in some way.

Riot becomes the new Blizzard

Robin: Blizzard’s fortunes have seemed increasingly shaky over the last couple of years. Just when you thought the most unpopular thing they’d do in the decade was announce a mobile game, they decided to spark an international incident. Stories from inside the studio are troubling, too, with reports implying that the company culture may have been changing for the worse for years. Meanwhile, Riot’s made its play, announcing a billion games and an entire multi-media empire in one press conference. I don’t think all its gambles will pay off, but I could easily see its star being more ascendant than ever over the next ten years, while Blizzard’s increasingly dwindles.

Fraser: Riot’s had even more issues that Blizzard, and while it’s designing several games that will inevitably compete with Blizzard’s, I don’t think it’s ever going to reach the same heights. It’s arguably been squandered, but Blizzard’s long legacy is part of the reason that, even now, it’s beloved by a legion of fans, whereas Riot has one game that’s infamous for its toxic community. I’m not sure how Blizzard is going to come out of the next decade and I wouldn’t be surprised if its popularity did dwindle, but I’m don’t think anything will replace it.

Steven: Sorry, Fraser. I'm with Robin on this one. That one game you mentioned also happens to be the world's most popular with a daily player count that probably beats every Blizzard game combined. Toxic community notwithstanding, I think Riot's aggressive expansion is similar to Marvel's Cinematic Universe and has all the potential to be just as popular.

BioWare fades away

James: Dragon Age 4 sounds nice, but it can't land too short of Modern Classic if BioWare wants to bring back its former reputation as one of the better big-budget storytellers in games. With so many new vacancies left by longtime employees and the constant shuffling around of those who remain, my faith in BioWare's delivery is at an all time low. To be clear, I'm not hopeless, I'm just... not optimistic.

Steven: I agree. I think this tail-end of the 2010s has shown that nothing gold can stay and sometimes beloved studios lose their way. With BioWare, I'm increasingly worried that they're no longer the studio I fell in love with 20 years ago. There's too much riding on Dragon Age 4, and that makes me worried that if BioWare cracks under the pressure again it'll be another Anthem-like disaster.

VR finally breaks through

Tyler: VR won't replace screens—that'd mean the death of popular genres, and be totally inaccessible for some—but by 2030 it will be much more popular. All-in-one headsets with built-in tracking will accurately detect the movements of our feet, hands, and joints, as well as our facial expressions, making our Sonic meme avatars extremely lifelike.

James: I'm not convinced. I mean, I think it will be more affordable and accessible, but I think the inconveniences will quickly outweigh the novelty. Wearing a big headset, closing yourself off to your surroundings, holding a bright magnified image inches from your eyes—the effect is astounding, for a while at least. And then it's exhausting. And then normal. The adoption rate will swell and deflate with every incremental update or 'killer app' until the promise of a virtual world isn't all that exciting anymore. Half-Life: Alyx will be great, though.

Chris: Maybe, but I think it's still going to give a lot of people motion sickness, which is something that might get even worse as the fidelity of VR gets better. That means a lot of people will still be slowly teleporting around inside games rather than using normal locomotion because it just messes with our brains and bodies in ways that no amount of technology can solve. Motion sickness is going to continue to keep VR a niche interest and a cool novelty rather than a breakout phenomenon.

Ray tracing and 4K become the new standard

Tyler: At the start of the '10s, people were complaining about not being able to read text on their SD TVs. In the decade that followed, 1080p became normal, and then 4K TVs became normal. Still, true 4K gaming (as in, no upscaling) is considered high-end today. This is a boring, conservative prediction, but I'm going to say that'll happen again: 4K fully replaces 1080p and 1440p sometime in the '20s, and by the end of the decade, 8K and up are the high-end choices.

James: I'm too dumb to nod my head at the ray-tracing bit, but I'm fairly certain 4K will be the new 1080p. Just 10 years ago, the most popular resolution was 1280x800 . We're on pace to make 4K the norm. But what then? 4K is enough, right? What then?

PC hardware advances will slow way down

Jarred: I'm going to piggyback off Tyler here, but focus on processors and manufacturing technologies. The fun prediction would be to assume Moore's Law is alive and well and computers continue to progress in leaps and bounds. The reality: we're hitting a wall. Actually, we've been hitting walls for the past decade, but each new wall becomes taller and thicker. Ten years ago, a state-of-the-art CPU was manufactured on 45nm tech, and GPUs were on 55nm. We've gone through three or four transitions since then (32nm, 22nm, 14nm, and kind of 10nm for Intel; 40nm, 28nm, 16/12nm, and 7nm for TSMC). Ten years from now, I expect three transitions at most (eg, 5nm, 4nm, and 3nm), but the real improvements from each process shrink will become less noticeable. A Core i9-9900K or Ryzen 9 3900X will still be doing okay, but your graphics card will have been upgraded several times, because 4K 144Hz gaming isn't happening on today's GPUs.

James: The time for smellovision is nigh.

The most popular game is from a genre we've never heard of

Tyler: Battle royale games didn't exist in 2010. Neither did autobattlers like Dota Auto Chess. Roguelikes were just starting to make a comeback as 'roguelites'. No one was using 'walking simulator' as a term of endearment or criticism. No one was searching for the term 'soulslike' until 2015. There were no 'strand games' that I can recall, because it's something Hideo Kojima made up. Only time will tell if he's on to something.

James: Like, what's going to be so new that Fortnite kids think it's too obtuse or naive to get into? I couldn't have predicted Fortnite, but I'm thinking whatever comes next will come from the increased scale and level of simulation new technologies will allow. Better graphics aren't the thing, I'm thinking about how the novelty of 100 people shooting each other on an island was enough to birth BR. Layer in way more and much deeper systems, be it weather, physics, building, lighting—whatever really—and the new ideas will spill out of the dev scene and onto the internet. That's my aspirational take. It'll actually be something that emerges from dumb luck.

We won't buy PC games anymore

Harry: Ok, hear me out. I'm not saying we're all just going to up and put down our mouse and keyboards en masse, but by the end of 2030, individually buying games to keep will just seem weird. Services like Xbox Game Pass for PC will be joined by others looking for a lucrative slice of the subscription-service pie, and become ubiquitous. Just like Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Hulu did for the small screen, we'll be juggling various Game Pass-like products and never really own anything. Because we're millennials and don't deserve to.

Rachel: I don't think we'll buy PC games anymore because I feel a majority of games will choose to take the free-to-play route. Many of the biggest games right now are free-to-play and I reckon this style of business model will be an overwhelming majority in 2030. Fortnite's micropayments model has overwhelmingly proven that it's a viable route for gaming companies. Instead of buying games, the focus will turn more to buying in-game virtual goods and premium features.

Dwarf Fortress simulates meta consciousness, dwarves realize they're inside the simulation

Dwarf Fortress creator Tarn Adams has said he wants to simulate all the ""narratively interesting"" aspects of existence, and I'm betting that means we'll 100 percent have a Dwarf Fortress Truman Show moment sometime in the next decade. Dwarves already have complex mental and emotional states, so it's not a leap to imagine them becoming self-aware enough to realize they're fictional beings inside a massive simulation. The question is, what will the do when they find out?

Loot boxes will be a thing of the past

Robin: Though some of their stealthier forms might survive—‘card packs’, for example—I think your run-of-the-mill loot boxes aren’t long for this world. There’s just too much scrutiny on them these days. If government regulation doesn’t kill them, publisher skittishness will, and they’ll end up banished to the same graveyard online passes got chucked in. The catch? I think they’ll be replaced by something even more insidious.

James: Loot boxes will just get supplanted by data collection psyops. Destiny 2 is almost already there, a collection of feedback systems on a micro and macro level, from the recoil after pulling the trigger and the gas escaping from where the Cabal's head used to be to the little sound and animation that plays when turning in a bounty. Service based games are endless fonts of granular information, so the structures to tune player experiences to the individual will likely take shape. Attention will become a higher priority than how microtransactions are presented. We might see them disappear completely.

Bethesda will stop making singleplayer games altogether

Chris: Bethesda will release Starfield and The Elder Scrolls 6 at some point in the next decade, but after that? I wouldn't be completely surprised if we never saw another traditional singleplayer RPG developed by the studio. I don't much care for Fallout 76, and I'm not alone. But there must be tons of people still playing it because it keeps chugging along, and even the resoundingly unpopular Fallout 1st subscription has plenty members—pop into a session and you're bound to come across a few. I expect Bethesda will get better at making online games this coming decade, and if they do the focus will drift away from singleplayer RPGS entirely.",https://www.pcgamer.com/our-biggest-pc-gaming-predictions-for-the-next-decade/,,,"[""Netflix's The Witcher"", 'Podcasts', 'The 2010s']"

5176,1579836565,['Media Release'],Corrections Commitment to Public Safety Throughout COVID-19,en,,,,,"By Rachel Noll, DOC Communications

The Washington State Department of Corrections (DOC) is privileged to have staff well trained in emergency management. During statewide and national emergencies, the DOC stands ready to respond internally to protect the health and safety of staff and the incarcerated, and externally to provide support to other state or federal agencies.

Steps Taken During COVID-19

Corrections began supporting the Department of Health (DOH) response to COVID-19 on February 9, 2020, by providing members of Corrections’ Department Incident Management Team (DIMT) to help the statewide response. The department officially opened its Emergency Operations Center (EOC) at headquarters in response to COVID-19 on March 2, 2020, whose members represent every division across the agency.

While the state is under a “Stay Home, Stay Healthy” order, Corrections remains open and operational as an essential business. The safety and well-being of the incarcerated, staff and public are the department’s top priorities.

Corrections has taken a number of steps to ensure the safety of those incarcerated in correctional facilities and work release, as well as those on community supervision. These steps include suspending visitation and other in-person programming to reduce outside exposure, encouraging pro-active precautions like hand-washing, extra cleaning and social distancing, and reducing the number of face-to-face contact visits community corrections officers have to make with those they supervise.

The department is also encouraging staff to stay home when sick, practice social distancing and telework wherever possible. Every staff member that needs to report in person for work receives a verbal and temperature health screening when they enter any correctional facility. The agency recently approved staff to wear expired N95 respirators (pdf). The department continues to monitor the situation to determine if additional steps are necessary as new guidance is made available.

To demonstrate the department’s commitment to openness and transparency, Corrections has posted important information on the COVID-19 Information Center, including memos, resources and decision points.

Current Protocols Followed

Corrections’ Chief Medical Officer and her team have developed protocols (pdf) that follow recommendations for isolation and quarantine set forth by DOH and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), which are updated as needed to reflect the latest guidance.

Employees who test positive for COVID-19 self-quarantine at home for at least 14 days. Corrections also works to identify and notify employees considered to have had close contact with a staff member with positive COVID-19 test results. Those determined to have been in close contact with the positive individual will be asked to self-quarantine at home for up to 14 days from the date of last contact with the employee who tested positive, following DOH guidelines.

If an incarcerated individual shows symptoms or tests positive, they will be isolated and treated. Those who have been in contact will be quarantined even if they are asymptomatic under the same guidelines followed under other quarantines, such as those that occur during outbreaks of the stomach flu.

Corrections Assistance in Statewide Response

In addition to the internal response, the DIMT provided logistics support to DOH along with the Washington Department of Social and Health Services and the Washington Military Department – Emergency Management Division with the statewide response to COVID-19. The support is possible because the Department of Corrections trains employees in the National Incident Management System (NIMS), the national structure for emergency response enabling state and federal agencies that typically do not work together, to operate under the same structure and unified command during an emergency.

“Real world emergencies, whether it be a flood, hurricane, volcano or pandemic, provide the opportunity for our agency employees to hone their skills in emergency management and incident command,” said Emergency Operations Manager Greg Miller. “Assisting other agencies drastically increases our knowledge, skills and abilities to manage our own emergencies when they arise in the department. Above and beyond DIMT, the Department of Corrections staff statewide are always ready and willing to help out. These staff are doing great work in the offices, prisons and community during this time.”

The DIMT provided Command, Logistics and Planning staff to the Unified Command at the State Emergency Operations Center. DOC staff also provided communications support as the state stood up its Joint Information Center. Working together during an emergency allows each state agency to continue its operations, work together as a team and have a role in helping Washington to ‘flatten the curve’.

Incarcerated individuals have also expressed a desire to help. Correctional Industries (CI) workers at Coyote Ridge Corrections Center have adapted their knowledge from the textile factory to produce protective gowns to respond to the need for Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). CI workers across the state are also working to produce additional gowns, protective masks and face shields.

“Partnerships such as this show the department’s commitment to both our mission, ‘To improve public safety by positively changing lives’ as well as our vision, ‘Working together for safer communities,’” said Secretary Steve Sinclair. “Corrections is committed to working together with other state agencies to help support the best emergency response possible, as we know our role in creating safer communities extends beyond our commitment to operating a safe and humane corrections system. We value our partnership with others as we work to transform lives for a better Washington.”",http://masonwebtv.com/archives/38973,,,

In a zoom consultation among officials of the Department of Education (DepEd) held under the auspices of the Federation of Associations of Private Schools Administrators (FAPSA), the group declared its intention to open most classes for school year 2020-2021 in June instead of the DepEd decision to resume classes in August or IATF recommendation to hold classes in September.

Eleazardo Kasilag, the group’s president, said FAPSA member-schools can hold online classes for the entire school year, stressing that “private schools have better program in tablet education where teachers are trained to the set up and the connectivity is strong and the modules for the curriculum is available.”

“FAPSA member-schools have sound connectivity and the students have the required gadget to allow them to catch up with modular lessons installed in the gadget. Some private schools have been doing this tablet education almost a decade ago. Our teachers are also exposed to this and may need only refresher course,” he said.

5211,1506125866,,NanoSurface Biomedical Introduces 384-well NanoSurface Plate™ at SLAS 2020 – Silicon Valley Daily,en,,,,,"SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--#biotech--NanoSurface Biomedical, a leading provider of biomimetic cell-based assay products and services, announced today the launch of the 384-well NanoSurface Plate™, the newest and highest-throughput offering of the NanoSurface Plates™ product line. NanoSurface Plates™ structure cell cultures into physiologically relevant tissue models by providing biomimetic topographic features that emulate the alignment of the native cellular microenvironment. For example, stem cell-derived cardiomyocyte cells can be cultured in NanoSurface Plates™ to create cardiac microtissues for predictive preclinical drug screening.

Human stem-cell based assays hold great promise for modeling the safety and efficacy of drugs preclinically. However, these models can fail to properly represent human biology when the in vitro environment does not reproduce essential cues. Conventional glass or plastic cell culture dishes fail to imitate critical aspects of the native cellular microenvironment, resulting in cell cultures that do not adequately resemble the structure or function of native human tissues.

NanoSurface Plates™ feature a softer nanopatterned culture surface that mimics the aligned architecture of the native extracellular matrix. Cells on NanoSurface Plates™ exhibit more physiologically representative structural and functional phenotypes. NanoSurface Plates™ can be used to enhance preclinical cell-based assays with a wide variety of cell types, including those with cardiomyocytes, skeletal muscle cells, neurons, migratory cancer cells, and many more.

Dr. Nicholas Geisse, Chief Science Officer of NanoSurface Biomedical, will present data highlighting NanoSurface technologies at the scientific podium session “Cellular Technologies - Application of Organ-on-chips and Micro-Physiological Systems” at the annual Society for Laboratory Automation and Screening Conference on Monday, January 27. The focus of the presentation will be on engineering the cell niche to enhance iPSC-derived cardiomyocyte maturity and predictivity in a high-throughput, assay-agnostic manner.

“At NanoSurface, we strive to make cells in the dish resemble cells in the body,” said Michael Cho, CEO of NanoSurface Biomedical. “The 384-well NanoSurface Plate™ allows drug developers to culture more physiologically relevant cells and tissues in a high-throughput, reproducible, and scalable format that will enhance their drug screening workflows.”

384-well NanoSurface Plates will be available March 2020. Pre-orders are available today via the NanoSurface contact form.

NanoSurface Biomedical will exhibit at SLAS 2020 in Booth 2120.

However, when Sanjay Barve was asked about it, he said the firm offered its services free of cost and there was no question of any financial gains to it.

The project of police records' digitisation was awarded to CrispQ Information Technologies Pvt Ltd for five years by the previous Devendra Fadnavis-led government before the state Assembly polls were held in October last year, the sources said.

The company is owned by Barve's son Sumukh Barve and wife Sharmila Barve.

The firm sent a proposal on September 30, 2019 to the state government, offering its service ""pro bono"" (work undertaken voluntarily and without payment) to provide paperless office system to the Mumbai Police through a software called 'Notesheet Plus', an official said.

A copy of the proposal was marked to the Chief Minister's Office (CMO), he said.

Records, complaints and service documents of the Mumbai Police personnel were to be digitised with the help of the specified software, the official said.

The proposal was approved by the government as the company was going to do the work for free, and the Mumbai Police Commissioner's office was also directed to finalise the number of units and files for the digitisation work, the official said.

However, the project did not start due to some technical issues, he added.

When contacted, Sanjay Barve said, ""The company had offered its service 'pro bono' and it was for the benefit of the Mumbai Police.""

The software, which was offered to be used by the company, is free and there is no question of any financial gains to the firm, he said.

Sanjay Barve is retiring from service on February 29.

5229,1539690766,"['Sky Palma', 'Brad Reed', 'Travis Gettys', 'Pro Publica']",Trump’s erratic messaging on coronavirus is creating a ‘communications nightmare’ for health officials: report,en,,,,,"According to POLITICO’s Joanne Kenen, when it comes to the coronavirus, President Trump “is using his metaphorical black Sharpie to draw his own mental map” of the growing crisis, and it’s making the work of health officials much more difficult.

Kenen cites the example of Trump’s questioning of the World Health Organization’s estimate that says the global mortality rate for the coronavirus at 3.4 percent. In an interview with Fox News’ Sean Hannity, Trump said he thinks the 3.4 percent figure is a “false number.”

ADVERTISEMENT

“Public health experts have noted the WHO’s estimate may change as more is learned about the spread of the virus; thousands of non-fatal cases likely have gone undetected,” Kenen writes. “But while the death rate may dip below 3.4 percent, everything that’s known so far suggests it won’t plummet to a level that’s not alarming. And it’s already hitting some populations, like the elderly, disproportionately hard.” (It should be noted that Trump’s questioning of the 3.4 rate was simply a reference to an opinion voiced by the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci.)

When it comes to the outbreak’s seriousness, White House officials “have been all over the place,” according to Kenen. “The president has accused Democrats and the media of hyping the virus — one that’s killed thousands worldwide — to hurt his reelection prospects, calling the criticism ‘their new hoax,'” he writes. “And he’s repeatedly hinted that a vaccine is coming soon, despite being told directly and repeatedly that in the most optimistic scenario it’s at least a year away.”

Experts are calling the mixed messaging a “communications nightmare” for health officials, and making matters worse, that mixed messaging is coming from an administration that has a history of denying science — and now thanks to Trump, they have to worry about how talking about the crisis will affect the stock market.

“Scientists who contradict Trump sometimes run into a buzz saw — or in the case of Trump’s false predictions on Hurricane Dorian last fall, pressure to walk back the facts.”

On behalf of the Centre, Additional Solicitor General KM Natraj had moved the top court seeking an urgent hearing on its appeal challenging the Delhi High Court verdict which held on Wednesday that the Nirbhaya death row convicts have to be executed together and not separately.

The Centre told the top court that Tihar Jail authorities are unable to execute the convicts in the case despite the fact that their review petitions have been dismissed and curative petitions and mercy pleas of three of them have been rejected.

The high court had set a week's deadline for them to avail the remaining remedies. If the convicts choose not to make any type of petition in seven days from now, the institutions/ authorities concerned will deal with the matter, as per the law, without further delay, it said.

Meanwhile, a trial court on Thursday sought the response of the four convicts on the plea of Tihar jail authorities seeking issuance of fresh death warrants against them.

The trial court had on January 31 stayed ""till further orders"" execution of the four convicts in the case -- Mukesh Kumar Singh (32), Pawan Gupta (25), Vinay Kumar Sharma (26) and Akshay Kumar (31), who are lodged in Tihar Jail.

Later, the Centre moved the High Court against the stay of the execution of the convicts. Hours after the high court's verdict, the Centre filed an appeal against it in the apex court.

Akufo-Addo, Prez Ghana

President Nana Akufo-Addo has said Ghana, “for the first time in over 40 years”, has maintained “a fiscal deficit below five per cent of GDP for three years in a row”.

Delivering his State of the Nation Address to a one-sided Parliament on Thursday, 20 February 2020, Mr Akufo-Addo also said “in three years, we have reduced inflation to its lowest level (7.8% in January 2020) since 1992”.

“For the first time in over 20 years, the balance of trade (that is the difference between our exports and imports) has been in surplus for three (3) consecutive years.

“Our current account deficit is shrinking, interest rates are declining, and the average annual rate of depreciation of the cedi is at its lowest for any first term government in the Fourth Republic.

“Our economic growth has rebounded to place Ghana among the fastest growing economies in the world for three years in a row at an annual average of 7%, up from 3.4% in 2016, the lowest in nearly three decades”, the President said.

According to him, the international community has taken note of his government’s performance, “resulting in Ghana, today, being the largest recipient of foreign direct investment in West Africa”.

“The sovereign credit ratings agencies have upgraded our ratings, and also improved the outlook for this year, notwithstanding the fact that it is an election year.

“This is a massive vote of confidence in the current management of the economy, as best illustrated by Ghana’s successful issue of the longest-dated Eurobond ever issued by a sub-Saharan African country, with investors placing fifteen billion United States dollars ($15 billion) of orders for Ghana’s forty-one (41) year Eurobond.

“The seven (7) year Bond attracted the lowest coupon rates ever for Ghana at six point three-seven-five percent (6.375%), compared with the nine point two-five percent (9.25%) Ghana had to pay for a similar Eurobond issue in 2016. No wonder Bloomberg, the reputable global financial media house, earlier this week, highlighted Ghana as the top candidate for an economic leap in Africa.

“This expression of confidence is important because it will lead to enhanced investments in our economy, and the accompanying greater numbers of jobs”, he said.",https://www.ghanamma.com/2020/02/21/3-time-under-5-fiscal-deficit-first-time-in-40-years-akufo-addo/,,,

The Providence victory gave the Big East three teams in the Sweet 16. Five leagues have two; Big Ten, Big 12, Pac-12, ACC and the West Coast Conference. Rounding out the field are the SEC (Auburn), the Atlantic-10 (Dayton), and the Mountain West (Utah State).

Here’s the Day 4 roundup of games:

SOUTH REGIONAL

No. 1 Baylor 87, No. 8 Saint Mary’s 56>> The Gaels’ season came to an agonizingly slow end. They fell behind early, trailed by 18 at half and by 33 with 11:44 to play. It was their worst loss since a 94-46 embarrassment at Gonzaga in February 2019. Butler (28-4) was led in scoring, as it has been all season, by its trio of guards. Davion Mitchell 20 points), MaCio Teague (17) and Jared Butler (15), none of whom had shot better than 42% during the regular season, all shot better than 50%.

Jordan Ford, wrapping up a four-year career that could put his No. 3 in the rafters at Saint Mary’s, scored 24 points, but nobody else was in double figures. Malik Fitts, who made seven 3-pointers in the first-round victory over Rutgers, had only seven points. The Gaels (27-9) shot poorly from everywhere: 3 of 16 from behind the arc, nine of 15 from the free throw line, and 36.7% overall. (We did not attempt to reach coach Randy Bennett after this one.)

No. 6 Virginia 63, No. 3 Michigan State 59>> The Cavaliers, who run-and-gunned their way to a season-high 82 points in the opening round (25 points over their season average) returned to character. With its slow-paced offense and smothering defense, Virginia held MSU to 25 first-half points, limiting the Spartans to 19 shots, seven of which they blocked, and forcing seven turnovers. Still, the Spartans had a chance to tie the game with 11 seconds left, but Rocket Watts missed a wide-open three from the corner and Virginia sealed the outcome with two free throws from Jay Huff. Mamadi Diakite had 21 points and eight rebounds for the UVA (25-7) and Braxton Key added 13 points and 13 rebounds. MSU (23-10) was led by three players with 11 points, including Xavier Tillman, who also had 11 rebounds.

No. 2 Creighton 76, No. 7 Illinois 69 >>- The Bluejays, the only surviving 2-seed in the tournament, trailed by 11 points in the second half and were down 65-59 with 4:16 to play. But they closed the game on a 17-4 run during which they held Illinois scoreless on eight consecutive possessions. Denzel Mahoney came off the bench for 17 points to lead Creighton (26-7). Damien Jefferson had 15 and Ty-Shon Alexander and Marcus Zegarowski added 12 apiece. Kofi Cockburn had 16 points and 10 rebounds to lead Illinois (22-10).

WEST REGIONAL

No. 1 Gonzaga 88, No. 9 Oklahoma 70>> Cory Kispert led six players in double figures and the Zags broke open a close game midway through the second half. An 8-2 run — the first six points coming from Joel Ayayi –turned a 50-45 lead into an 11-point lead and the Sooners never got back within 10. Kispert had 17 points, Filip Petrusev had 12, and four others had 11, including Ayayi. Austin Reaves scored 17 to lead Oklahoma (20-13).

No. 6 BYU 100, No. 14 Eastern Washington 97>> Zac Seljaas’ 3-point shot from the right wing broke a 93-93 tie with 1:37 to play, Andy Toolson followed with another three and the Cougars escaped the upset-minded Eagles from the Big Sky Conference. BYU made 13 of 22 three-point attempts (59.1%) and shot almost 60% overall (40 of 67) and then held its collective breath as a last-second shot by EWU circled the rim twice before spinning out. TJ Haws (26 points, 12 assists) and Yoeli Childs (26 points, 11 rebounds) led the way for BYU. Jacob Davison had 29 points for EWU (24-9).

No. 7 Arizona 89, No. 15 UC-Irvine 66>> Zeke Nnaji had 18 points and 17 rebounds as the Wildcats put an early end to the Anteaters’ hope of pulling another upset. UC-Irvine, which shocked No. 2 seed San Diego State on Friday, led 17-16 after a 3-pointer by Jeron Artest (son of Ron Artest). But Arizona answered with a bucket and two free throws from Max Hazzard (grandson of the late Walt Hazzard) and the Wildcats led the rest of the way. Tony Rutherford had 15 points for UCI (22-11). Arizona’s Nico Mannion led all scorers with 19.

MIDWEST REGIONAL

No. 3 Duke 98, No. 14 East Tennessee State 89>> The upstarts from the Southern Conference, who had stunned Seton Hall in the opener, jumped out to a 7-1 lead. And that’s where Duke put a stop to things. The Blue Devils caught the Eagles at 16, passed them on a tip-in by Javin DuLaurier and never trailed after a 10-0 run put them ahead 49-39. ETU, winners of 13 straight, pulled within 78-75, but then went cold for almost six minutes as Duke rebuilt its lead to 13 and coasted into Sweet 16 for the 16th time in 20 years. Vernon Carey led the Blue Devils with 17 points and 10 rebounds. Tre Jones, playing amid rumors that he will apply for the NBA draft, had 16 points, eight assists, and six rebounds. Cassius Stanley also had 16 points. Patrick Good had 22 for ETU, which finished the season 31-4.

No. 7 Providence 104, No. 15 North Dakota State 57>> The Friars jumped on the team that had KO’d Kentucky two days earlier, scoring the first seven points en route to a 20-5 lead. Providence led 51-33 at halftime and didn’t let up, outscoring the Bison 53-24 in the second half. Luwane Pipkins led six Friars in double figures with 19 points, hitting 5 of 7 treys. Alpha Diallo added 14 points and 10 rebounds. Rocky Kreuser had 16 to lead North Dakota State (26-9), which had won 13 of its previous 14 games.",https://www.santacruzsentinel.com/2020/03/26/missing-march-madness-we-did-too-so-heres-the-sweet-16/,,,"['2020 Election', 'Athlete of the Week']"

Special-Reporter

Kissimmee, Florida

USA

Palacio nacional, R. D.-El ministro de la Presidencia de lla Repubblica Dominicana y coordinador de la Comisión de Alto Nivel para la Prevención y el Control del Coronavirus (COVID-19), Gustavo Montalvo, desmintió que el conjunto de la actividad económica se abrirá el próximo 11 de mayo.

“Esta información es falsa. Lo que sí es cierto es que desde la Comisión estamos trabajando un proyecto para la gradual reapertura de la actividad comercial, económica e institucional. Pero no se ha establecido aún ninguna fecha”, aclaró.

Explicó que para el diseño del plan de reapertura se están tomando en cuenta dos factores: preservar la salud de la población y, al mismo tiempo, la economía de las familias.

“Para ello, estamos estudiando diferentes alternativas, teniendo en cuenta tanto los modelos que están adoptando otros países, como la realidad epidemiológica y económica dominicana. Esta fase de investigación no ha concluido aún”.

Sostuvo que es importante que “todos sigamos como hasta ahora. Que los comercios sigan cerrados excepto los que tienen permiso para operar. Que la gente permanezca en sus casas todo lo posible. Que se respete el toque de queda. Y que para informarse, siempre se acuda a fuentes oficiales”.

“Pueden estar todos seguros de que cuando haya una decisión definitiva sobre el plan de reapertura será compartida en su totalidad con la sociedad dominicana y, por supuesto, con los medios de comunicación”.

Caso Puerto Plata

Con relación al caso de Puerto Plata, informó que cumplida la semana de cuarentena impuesta en esta ciudad, tras la actividad multitudinaria llevada a cabo el pasado 26 de abril, se ha decidido renovarla por una semana adicional.

“Todas las medidas ya en marcha para impedir el crecimiento de los contagios se mantendrán vigentes hasta el próximo lunes día 11 de mayo a las 6 de la mañana”.

Estas medidas incluyen:

•Limitación de movimiento, traslados, tránsito y circulación de personas en el municipio Puerto Plata; y control en los accesos. Desde luego, se permitirá la circulación de alimentos e insumos necesarios bajo control sanitario.

•Disposición de alejamiento físico de 2 metros entre personas en la vía pública y áreas sociales.

•Investigación operativa epidemiológica: búsqueda mediante pruebas rápidas de casos sospechosos y de positivos sintomáticos para aislamiento domiciliario y en centros de aislamiento según criterio epidemiológico.

•Aumento de las capacidades de pruebas rápidas administradas por la dirección provincial de Salud y de la disponibilidad de forma gratuita de las pruebas confirmatorias PCR.

•Apertura 24 horas de toda la red de servicios de atención primaria, habilitación de camas de hospitalización y de cuidados intensivos.

•Sesión permanente del Comité Provincial de Prevención, Mitigación y Respuesta ante Desastres que integra instituciones públicas y privadas.

•Activación de la coordinación local y provincial del Comité de Emergencias del Centro de Operaciones de Emergencias (COE).

Ministerio de Salud ejecutará, este jueves, plan reducción incidencia COVID-19 en Distrito Nacional; saluda acciones La Vega y Ocoa

El ministro de Salud Pública de la República Dominicana, Dr. Rafael Sánchez Cárdenas, informó que este jueves será puesto en operación un plan para la reducción de la incidencia del coronavirus (COVID-19) en el Distrito Nacional.

El lanzamiento de la iniciativa se realizará en la alcaldía de esta demarcación y contará con la integración del gobierno local, el Centro de Operaciones de Emergencias (COE) y otras instituciones.

La Vega

En ese mismo orden, destacó la buena marcha de los trabajos en La Vega, a partir del lanzamiento del plan que se implementa allí contra la enfermedad y que ha contado con una gran participación del senador de la provincia, Euclides Sánchez, quien ha estado en contacto de los principales actores de esa comunidad.

Este accionar incluye las instituciones de salud, iglesias, empresarios y otros. También felicitó al alcalde de La Vega, Kelvin Cruz, por su integración.

‘‘Felicitamos y apoyamos este activismo de las autoridades veganas en estas labores de coordinación de todos los sectores. Estamos procurando una Vega libre de COVID-19’’, dijo.

San José de Ocoa

Igualmente, saludó las ejecutorias en la provincia San José de Ocoa, tanto del personal de los hospitales así como de la Dirección Provincial de Salud y sus epidemiólogas por la organización de la respuesta que localmente se está llevando a cabo.

Hacer caso a informaciones oficiales

En cuanto al consumo de informaciones relacionadas al coronavirus en el país y las medidas a tomar frente a esta situación, el ministro de Salud exhortó a la población a hacer caso a las emitidas de manera oficial y no llevarse de voces que pudieran motivar intranquilidad.

Casi 2,000 recuperados; letalidad continúa bajando: 4.17%

Sánchez Cárdenas dio estas declaraciones previo a ofrecer, por webconferencia, el boletín número 47 con un balance actual del COVID-19 en el país.

Esta webconferencia cuenta con una amplia interacción con periodistas de diferentes puntos del territorio nacional, en la que hacen planteamientos y preguntas que son respondidas por el funcionario de salud.

A la fecha, el boletín recoge 8,480 casos confirmados, 1,905 personas recuperadas, 354 fallecimientos y una letalidad de 4.17%, la cual sigue descendiendo.

25,856 son casos descartados por PCR sobre 34,336 muestras procesadas en laboratorios, representando una positividadde 23.01%.

El 80.32% de los casos confirmados (6,811) se concentra en 12 territorios: Santo Domingo de Guzmán (24.02), Santiago (10.75), Santo Domingo Este (9.03), San Francisco de Macorís 7.36), Santo Domingo Oeste (6.30), La Vega (5.39), Santo Domingo Norte (4.73), Puerto Plata (2.71), San Cristóbal (2.68), Moca (2.58), Bonao (2.51) y La Romana (2.25).

（本报美里3日讯）砂拉越华人社团联合总会会长拿督黄良杰表示，感谢砂拉越政府长期来开明对待各族文化与信仰，不但尊重各族的传统节庆，而且还加以推广与宣传，成就了今天砂拉越族群的亲善和融洽相处。

他是今晚出席美里省华人社团联合会在帝宫大酒店主办的2020庚子鼠年新春团拜晚宴上致词时，这么表示。

他说，农历新年是华人最重要的传统节庆，是一家团圆的好日子，起源于农业时代，大家欢庆春天回到了大地，大地又充满了生气，代表着希望与光明。

“华族先辈南来，把这个节庆带过来，也把祝福带过来，在这个节庆里我们常说祝福话，希望我们的同胞们都得到祝福。”

他表示，在砂拉越，农历新年和马来同胞的开斋节，原住民的丰收节等，都成了普天同庆的日子，大家彼此登门道贺，共同分享喜悦和祝愿。

华社也不忘砂拉越政府拨出土地给予华文独中作为以地养校的计划，同时制度化常年增加拨款给独中，更成为全国第一个承认华文独中统考文凭的政府。这些都是亲民的良好政策，也很体贴华社长期来的心愿和需求，并认可了华人在这片土地的贡献。

他认为，砂拉越必须捍卫族群和谐的现状，并进一步提升族群之间的互动和交流，奠定更深刻的族群关系。因此，华总将在这方面做出更积极的行动，我们将全面推动更多跨族群的交流活动。

“我们也建议砂拉越政府提供协助，带领我们民间同组织和机构架设更多互动平台，我相信会取得更好的效果。”

他说，砂华总作为华团的最高机构，除了作为官民之间的桥梁，也以“超越政党，不超越政治”的理念，关注政府的各项政策。对于有待加强的政策，他们经常提出建设性的意见；对于好的政策，他们也给予赞扬，希望政府再接再厉，造福百姓。

“一直以来，砂拉越政府愿意聆听华社的意见，这是令人感到欣慰的，我们也深表感谢。我也要感谢首席部长拿督巴丁宜阿邦佐哈里上任三年来，延续前任首席部长的开明作风，并继续推动许多惠民，亲民的政策，比如基本建设，公共设施，电子商务，交通发展等各方面的大力推动。其他方面，还包括推动绿色环保项目，在国外成立砂拉越贸易旅游中心，一系列乡区发展计划，全面支援农业发展，对政府部门进行制度化改革，资助砂拉越学子回乡过年过节，新生宝宝奖励，母亲做月子津贴，每户水费津贴等。我相信在不久的将来，这些好政策必定可以造福更多人，并必能在砂拉越的经济发展上取得连锁的效应及看到成长率倍增的成效。”

他也希望普罗大众可以去了解和应用政府提供的各项优惠，而政府的行政官员也可以妥善的推动这些良策。

他也呼呼更多的华裔子弟，无论是华文独中生或政府中学，国民型中学毕业生，未来更踊跃的投入到公共服务领域，成为政府公务员，为砂拉越广大人民服务，确保我们热爱的家乡越来越好。",https://web.archive.org/web/20200204122723id_/https://eunited.com.my/348111/,,,
5398,1534604368,,Mashrafe to tour Pakistan if BCB considers him,en,,,,,"SYLHET, Feb 29, 2020 (BSS)-Captain Mashrafe Bin Mortaza said he will be here for always in Bangladesh cricket’s needs as he is ready to do anything for the sake of the country’s cricket.

Mashrafe’s comment came in the wake of the question that whether he

would visit Bangladesh for a solitary ODI match if the Bangladesh Cricket

Board (BCB) wants. The most successful captain of the country is currently

playing just ODI format.

However Mashrafe’s future is not clear yet as the BCB president Nazmul

Hassan Papon indicated that the Zimbabwe series will be the lanky pacer’s

last as the captain since they would appoint a long term captain, eying 2023

World Cup. He also said, if Mashrafe wants to continue cricket, he should

prove his performance and match fitness to make him available.

“Firstly I don’t know what will happen after this series,” Mashrafe

said, replying to a query whether he would tour Pakistan.

“But in Bangladesh cricket’s needs, I am ready to go anywhere. What I

feel is that the BCB is our guardian. What decision they will take, they will

take it thinking not for once or twice, they will think about it for 10

times. So I believe they will take the best decision. We should consider

cricket board’s decision as final.”

Bangladesh has already twice visited Pakistan for first two legs of tour

that included a three-match T20 series and a first Test. On both occasion,

Mushfiqur Rahim opted against touring Pakistan, citing security reasons.

Bangladesh will visit Pakistan for last phase of tour that includes a

solitary ODI and second Test. Mushfiqur Rahim is believed to opt against

third phase of tour also.

“We should honour the decision of Mushfiqur Rahim,” Mashrafe said. “The

BCB has given the option to opt against touring Pakistan. Moreover the

selector will take the decision who will be the part of the team. If I am

called up for Pakistan tour, I will give my answer.”",http://www.bssnews.net/?p=355313,,,
5401,1539022268,,Sustainable fisheries plan for Caribbean Netherlands,en,,,,The Daily Herald - The Leading Newspaper for St. Maarten and the Northeast Caribbean,"Sustainable fisheries plan for Caribbean Netherlands

A means of existence under threat.

BONAIRE--A 2019 policy brief was just released, outlining requirements for sustainably managing fisheries within the Caribbean Netherlands. Using five different studies, a four-phase roadmap was created to bring local stakeholders and government legislators together to secure the future of local fish stocks.

Without action, a collapse of important fish species could be right around the corner, stated the Dutch Caribbean Nature Alliance (DCNA).

“Maintaining healthy coral reef and fish populations is fundamental in sustaining both the traditional way of life and ever-increasing tourism throughout the Caribbean. Although fisheries within this region are better managed today than they were in previous decades, the Caribbean is still facing an overall decrease in fish stocks.

“Managing the remaining fish populations requires balancing local cultural traditions with the reality of today's environmental conditions. Therefore, this must be a collaborative effort between residents, local and national governments, NGOs and buyers.”

According to the release, to better define the challenges and needs of local fisheries five different studies were conducted on historical fisheries, market analyses, communication and awareness, social mapping and co-management. The goal was to provide insight into how these local fisheries can be improved and sustained for years to come.

Although the final outcome of two of these studies are not yet available, preliminary results have been released to support the upcoming Sustainable Fisheries Plan by the Dutch Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality LNV. Mac & Field consultants, in collaboration with World Wildlife Fund (WWF) NL, used these to produce a policy brief to help in the creation of the Sustainable Fisheries Plan.

A common finding throughout each of these studies was that sustainable fishing practices are mostly lacking throughout the Caribbean Netherlands. This has led to an overexploitation or full exploitation of almost all commercial fish stocks.

Although the Ministry of LNV is responsible for fisheries management, implementation and regulation is not possible without the support from all stakeholders. This requires that enough resources are dedicated to this process (e.g. fisheries staff and budget within the local public entities) and open communication between stakeholders providing a feedback loop to meet the evolving needs of each island.

“Emphasising a co-management approach ensures the unique needs and desires of local stakeholders are considered in the design and implementation of a Sustainable Fisheries Management Plan. Fishermen must be included throughout each step of this process to maximise the likelihood that these regulations are implemented and complied with. Furthermore, new and non-traditional fishing activities (such as foreign fishing operations) should be considered within the management plan as well,” added DCNA.

“If left unmanaged, a collapse of certain local fish species is likely. As fish stocks continue to decrease, local and foreign demand continues to increase while coral reefs essential for healthy fisheries continue to decline. By working together, a truly Sustainable Fisheries Management Plan can and should be created and implemented ensuring fish stocks are available to local fishermen for many years to come.”",https://www.thedailyherald.sx/islands/sustainable-fisheries-plan-for-caribbean-netherlands,,,

“The economic hit will likely be more serious than the global financial crisis, and longer-lasting too, even beyond the end of the pandemic,” Lee Hsien Loong said in a Facebook post. He said the pandemic will likely last at least this year, and possibly longer.

With 200 infections, the Asian travel hub has signaled that there is a chance of a recession this year and has cut its growth forecasts.

Lee’s comments came a day after Singapore revised its electoral boundaries, in a move usually seen as a precursor to calling a vote. Singapore must hold elections by early 2021.

Govt Warns PSU Employees Of Action As About 25 Crore People Set To Participate In Bharat Bandh

The government has asked public sector undertakings to dissuade their employees from participating in the 'Bharat Bandh' called on Wednesday and advised them to prepare a contingency plan to ensure the smooth functioning of the enterprises.



According to news agency PTI, ten central trade unions have said around 25 crore people will participate in the nationwide strike to protest against the government's ""anti-people"" policies.

Trade unions INTUC, AITUC, HMS, CITU, AIUTUC, TUCC, SEWA, AICCTU, LPF, UTUC along with various sectoral independent federations and associations had adopted a declaration in September last to go on the nationwide strike on January 8.

""Any employee going on strike in any form, including protest, would face the consequences which, besides deduction of wages, may also include appropriate disciplinary action,"" said an office memorandum issued by the government.""

It also issued instructions not to sanction casual leave or another kind of leave to employees if applied for during the period of the proposed protest or strike and ensure that the willing employees are allowed hindrance-free entry into the office premises.

The instructions issued by the Department of Personnel & Training prohibit the Government servants from participating in any form of strike, including mass casual leave, go-slow and sit-down, or any action that abet any form of strike. Besides, pay and allowances are not admissible to an employee for his absence from duty without any authority.

The central trade unions are protesting against labour reforms, FDI, disinvestment, corporatisation and privatisation policies and to press for 12-point common demands of the working class relating to minimum wage and social security, among others.

About 60 organisations of students and elected office-bearers of some universities have also decided to join the strike with an agenda to raise voice against increased fee structure and commercialization of education.

The trade unions condemned the JNU violence and similar incidents in other university campuses and expressed their solidarity with students and teachers all over India.

The deceased, identified simply as G.O.D and Chairman of Zone 11 in the market, did not die in the inferno.

He was said to have slumped in the market “after seeing that his five shops were completely destroyed by the fire.”

He was reportedly rushed to a private hospital in the area but was said to have died later.

It was gathered that the fire, which destroyed goods valued at millions of naira, started at about 1:30 am.

Mr Edwin Okadigbo, the Public Relations Officer of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC), Anambra command, confirmed the incident in Awka.

Okadigbo, an Assistant Superintendent, said that nobody died in the fire because it occurred in the night when traders had all retired to their homes.

He said: “No life was lost in the fire, but the chairman of Zone 11, one Mr G.O.D, slumped after seeing his five shops razed down by the fire.

“He was rushed to the hospital but later gave up the ghost.”

He said that the fire destroyed so many shops and goods because of the highly inflammable nature of the goods sold in the market.

The NSCDC spokesman said that the fire was put out by men of the Anambra State Fire Service, assisted by operatives of other sister security agencies.

He said that the cause of the fire had yet to be ascertained but suspected it could either come from electrical fault or wildfire from the neighbourhood.

Meanwhile, the state Commandant of the corps, Mr David Bille, has expressed his condolences to the leadership of the market and traders, who lost their goods and other valuables, as well as the bereaved family.",https://www.pmnewsnigeria.com/2020/01/11/one-confirmed-dead-in-obosi-market-fire/,,,
5485,1517090369,"['René Caderius V Veen', 'Joanne Mccarty', 'Rene Caderius Van Veen', 'Andries Bonnema']",Opinion: Parent raises serious issues about Sacred Heart School,en,,,,,"Dear Editor,

On behalf of the vulnerable and seemingly voiceless, opinion-less youth of Saba, most of whom have been subjected to many injustices during their course of primary education on Saba, I request immediate action by those in authority, against the functioning of the Sacred Heart School.

I am very dissatisfied with the quality of education at the Sacred Heart School and the unobtrusive, unintelligent and uninformed decisions that continue to be made by the current administration. Calls to the school board to address the below mentioned issues remain unaddressed and I have lost all confidence in the management of this school.

The Sacred Heart School has come into direct violation of multiple rights of the child as per the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC). The information below gives an accurate illustration of this, as well as cases and occurrences that can be found edible, if investigated. However, for fear of victimization, the sources and other sensitive information shall not be named.

Article 3 — All organizations concerned with children should work towards what is best for each child”

The Sacred Heart School has failed many students of this school by individuals pushing their personal agendas, engaging in unethical teaching practices. Many children at this school voice their concerns, worries and discontentment. In the same breath, they are swiftly dismissed. Many children are unhappy and unmotivated to actively participate in their school experience; this is currently known among the Principal and her staff at the Sacred Heart School.

Article 12 — Children have the right to say what they think should happen when adults are making decisions that affect them and to have their opinions taken into account.”

The students of the Sacred Heart School continue to be shut down and dismissed repeatedly when they try to voice their opinions on matters that concern and directly affect them. Students continue to be blamed for the shortcomings of the management and staff; the adults of this institution do not hold themselves accountable for many incidents involving students, but rather, it is the child’s and parent’s fault. The students of this school have expressed no confidence and no trust in voicing their school-related concerns.

Article 16 — Children have the tight to privacy. The law should protect them from attacks against their way of life, their good name, their family and their home.”

The Sacred Heart School has acted unprofessionally, unethically and biased on numerous occasions in creating a vulnerability among the students by exposing their personal information, be it school- or home-based, to individuals outside of the school. This has been done via popular social media platforms and also in verbal conversations.

Article 23 — Children, who have any kind of disability should receive special care and support so that they can live a full and independent life.”

The principal, acting on behalf of the Sacred Heart School, has on more than one occasion expressed that the school is unable to accommodate students with special education needs, which leaves these students without any access to primary education. To date, there is no plan to address this educational gap. There is no differentiated learning taking place at the Sacred Heart School; the different levels of cognitive abilities and learning styles are not being catered to — “one shoe must fit all”.

Article 28 — Children have the right to an education. Discipline in schools should respect children’s human dignity. Primary education should be free. Wealthier countries should help poorer countries achieve this.”

Parents have been forced to seek alternative options to the Sacred Heart School within the last academic year, two of which have been confirmed to have left the island, because of the incompetence in working on a more holistic and much-needed educational approach that includes children of different cultures, background and cognitive capacities.

Article 5 — No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.”

The students of this school have been subjected to physical punishment, emotional abuse and educational neglect; a direct result of the failure to lead and protect each child under charge of the management of this school. The Sacred Heart School, has directly violated the Human Rights of their students, as per the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

The methods of discipline in the Sacred Heart School are not all “conscious” as they preach and the principal is well aware of this. There is evidence to support claims that students are regularly physically punished (and injured), placed out of classrooms, made to stand in the direct sunshine and deprived of their break times and food. Students have been verbally lambasted in front of entire classrooms, through degrading and derogatory comments by their teachers.

The Government of the Netherlands states, “In 2010 Leiden University and TNO (Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research) carried out a study into the scope and nature of child abuse. Every year an estimated 119,000 children experience some type of abuse.” There are five general types of child abuse, four of which the Sacred Heart School continues to demonstrate.

Physical abuse: all forms of physical violence;

Emotional or psychological abuse: an adult regularly berates the child, acts in a dismissive and hostile manner towards the child or intentionally scares the child;

Physical neglect: the child does not receive the care and nurturing that it needs;

Emotional or psychological neglect: continuous lack of positive attention for the child;

Ignoring the child’s need for love, warmth and security.

The UNICEF Situation Analysis of children in the Caribbean Netherlands (2019) notes the following about the common quality of education, factors that are specific to the shortcomings of the Sacred Heart School. Suitable education:

Cases of exclusion and challenges with behavior problems; to which the Sacred Heart School has no plan of action.

Participation at schools fragmented activities; not institutionalized.

Furthermore, I am not confident that the current Principal, who, in my opinion, has shown a dire lack of administrative skills, organizational skills and professional vision and knowledge, is capable of promoting the Second Educational Agenda, which covers the years 2017 up to and including 2020, one of the main objectives of this education agenda being ‘Ensuring that students in the Caribbean Netherlands receive education in 2020 that is of adequate quality.” By her inability to:

hire and retain qualified and experienced staff,

provide a structure and school climate that is conducive to learning,

be an advocate for all students of the Sacred Heart School,

motivate and inspire staff members,

be a team player,

reflect on and admit to her professional shortcomings,

communicate effectively with parents, teachers and other stakeholders,

be transparent in all her professional undertakings, I do not think this is the type of administrator that the Sacred Heart School needs and deserves at this point in time.

I believe that our children deserve better, better than what is currently being procured for the Sacred Heart School.

As previously stated, I am not confident in the board’s ability to act impartially, as they have been made privy to many issues at this school and continue to ignore them. Therefore, I am calling on the Executive Council or anyone in The Netherlands, who may read this letter, on behalf of the people of Saba, to act in the best interest of our future generations. Despite the fabricated reports that paint a different story, the truth is that our children have been and continue to be victimized, ill-treated and imperiled to a less than adequate primary education.

Enough is enough!

Concerned Saban

Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., vowed to challenge former Vice President Joe Biden on key issues at the upcoming Democratic primary debate as he rejected calls to drop out of the race following a disappointing finish on mini-Super Tuesday.

Sanders told supporters in his home state that he planned to stay in the race and was eager to spar with the front-runner at Sunday's debate in Phoenix.

""Last night was obviously not a good night for our campaign from a delegate point of view,"" Sanders said. ""What became even more apparent yesterday is that while we are currently losing the delegate count . . . we are strongly winning in two enormously important areas, which will determine the future of our country. Poll after poll shows that a strong majority of the American people support our progressive agenda.""

Numerous exit polls from Tuesday's races found that a majority of primary voters backed policies like Medicare for All, even in states which backed Biden.

""The American people are deeply concerned about the grotesque level of income inequality in this country and want corporations to start paying their fair share of taxes. Overwhelming support for that,"" Sanders added. ""Even in conservative states like Mississippi, there is an overwhelming understanding that we spend twice as much on health care as any other country. This crisis is becoming more and more obvious to the American people as we face the challenge of the coronavirus pandemic. Imagine facing a pandemic and having 87 million who are having a difficult time going to a doctor when they need it.""

""But it is not just the ideological debate that our progressive movement is winning,"" he continued. ""We are winning the generational debate. While Joe Biden continues to do very well with older Americans, especially those above 65, our campaign continues to win the majority of the votes of younger people . . . Not just people in their 20s. People in their 30s and their 40s.""

Sanders said that while he is winning the ideological debate, he is losing the ""electability debate"" as voters who say they agree with him on the issues argue that Biden has a better chance to beat President Donald Trump.

""Needless to say, I strongly disagree with that assertion. But that is what millions of Democrats and independents believe,"" he said. ""On Sunday, I very much look forward to the debate in Arizona with my friend, Joe Biden,"" he added, vowing to challenge Biden on issues such as climate change, college tuition, criminal justice, health care, immigration and income inequality.

""Today, I say to the Democratic establishment: In order to win in the future, you need to win the voters who represent the future of our country and speak to the issues of concern to them,"" he said.

""Let me conclude the way I began: Donald Trump must be defeated, and I will do everything in my power to make that happen,"" he added. ""Sunday night, the American people will have the opportunity to see which candidate is best positioned to accomplish that goal.""

Sanders' comments came after Biden pitched a message of unity Tuesday to his supporters.

""I want to thank Bernie Sanders and his supporters for their tireless energy and their passion. We share a common goal,"" he said. ""And together, we'll defeat Donald Trump. We'll defeat him together.

Biden extended his delegate lead Tuesday following a dominant performance that saw him win 10 of 14 states last week. Sanders lost Michigan and Missouri by wide margins despite effectively tying Hillary Clinton in those states in 2016. Biden has been buoyed by overwhelming support from older and black voters, while Sanders' young supporters have not turned out at the rate necessary to mitigate Biden's advantage among more reliable voting blocs.

Some of Biden's supporters called on Sanders to quit the race Tuesday.

Democratic strategist James Carville argued that Democrats ""can't diss"" the majority of voters who backed Biden and ""want to shut this thing down.""

""Let's shut this puppy down, and let's move on and worry about November,"" he said on MSNBC. ""This thing is decided. There's no reason to keep it going not even a day longer.""

Rep. Jim Clyburn, D-S.C., went a step further and argued that the Democratic National Committee should ""step in"" to cancel future debates.

""I think when the night is over, Joe Biden will be the prohibitive favorite to win the Democratic nomination . . . If the night ends the way it has begun,"" it is time to ""shut this primary down,"" Clyburn told NPR.

Sunday's debate will be held without a live audience due to precautions amid the spread of the coronavirus. Both candidates have also canceled rallies in upcoming primary states as the threat posed by the virus threatens to upend the race entirely, possibly making it more difficult for Sanders to gain ground.

Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Wash., the co-chair of Sanders' campaign, told CNN that Sanders ""earned his right to make his case at the debate.""

""There's no doubt that the polling and momentum right now is with Vice President Biden, and Sen. Sanders acknowledges that. But he does believe that debates in the past have changed, dramatically, the race,"" he said. ""There are a lot of things he is passionate about in his vision for America, and he feels he owes it to the millions of working-class people who have supported him to continue to raise those issues and share his vision.""",https://www.alternet.org/2020/03/bernie-sanders-rejects-calls-to-drop-out-and-vows-to-challenge-joe-biden-on-key-issues-at-debate/,,,['Religious right']

That’s up from 28 cases of the novel coronavirus among those troops less than a week ago.

The military has been deployed to nursing homes in the two provinces to reinforce workers overwhelmed by the illness, unable to keep up with residents’ needs because of all the protective measures they need to take, or off work because they’re ill themselves.

Fourteen of the military members with COVID-19 are in Ontario and 22 of them are in Quebec.

When the Forces started reporting the number of positive cases, they said they’d update the figures every two weeks but have revised that plan to give new numbers every day.

Trudeau says the premiers of Ontario and Quebec have both asked for the military to extend the deployment and he expects to agree.

5557,1484703270,['Jeff Spitzer-Resnick'],Op Ed: Losing Sheila’s Smile,en,,,,I’m now among some 40% of Americans who know someone killed with a gun.,"Get a daily rundown of the top stories on Urban Milwaukee

I have joined a club that is bigger than it should be and is certainly one that I definitely do not want to belong to. On Christmas Eve, my beautiful friend Sheila Green was murdered by her brother who suffered from psychosis. So now, I am one of the approximately 40% of Americans who know someone who was killed with a gun. That is an obscenely high number and is probably a low estimate as that study was done in 2015.

My wife, Sheryl, and I, met Sheila through mutual friends and through Sheryl’s work, when we first moved to Madison in 1985, as Sheila was an ultrasound tech at the same hospital where Sheryl did her medical residency. It was easy to become friends with Sheila as she had an ever present smile that always made you feel good when you saw her.

Sheila was also a chocolate aficionado, purchasing only the finest chocolates and baking up scrumptious chocolate treats on a regular basis. She was kind enough to share her flourless chocolate torte recipe with my wife, who has made countless of them over the years, and we think of Sheila every time we eat one. Sadly now, we will fondly remember her with each future torte.

Sheila came from a large family, and she was close with her many siblings. She did her best to care for her troubled brother. Sheila knew he owned a gun, and in fact, he had a concealed carry permit. She insisted that he not bring it to her home. For reasons we may never know, her brother did not honor that request on Christmas eve, and brought his gun to her home and shot and killed her.

Sheila’s friends and family are all grieving now for such a needless loss. It is especially needless because there are extreme risk protection laws in 17 states also known as red flag laws which are specifically designed to prevent murders by people who are known to be dangerous. These laws authorize courts to issue a protection order, allowing the police to temporarily confiscate firearms from people who are deemed by a judge to be a danger to themselves or to others.

Usually, the request for the order will come from relatives or friends concerned about a loved one who owns one or more guns and has expressed suicidal thoughts or discussed shooting people. Wisconsin, however, is not one of those states. Yet, it could easily have had this law in place in time to protect Sheila from her brother, who was a known danger who legally possessed a gun.

This past October, Gov. Tony Evers called a special legislative session to consider two common sense gun control measures: universal background checks and red flag legislation. Despite the fact that 80% of Wisconsin residents support passage of these laws, Republican legislative leaders refused to vote on, or even debate these popular measures.

In an utter act of contempt for voters, Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald dismissed the Senate in 30 seconds and Assembly Speaker Robin Vos dismissed the Assembly in 15 seconds. Gov. Evers has considered calling another special session on these measures, but thus far, has not done so.

One would like to believe that as society grows and learns, it improves. Yet, when it comes to gun control, the United States continues to behave as if there is nothing we can do to prevent gun violence, leaving our nation stuck in a warped 21st Century Wild, Wild West.

This is my tenth gun control post on my blog in seven years, and while sometimes I feel like giving up, I persist, because too many innocent lives are being snuffed out on a daily basis. Sadly, this time, she was a friend.

I grew up during the Vietnam War, and every Friday on the evening news, the anchorman would report the weekly body count of dead and wounded. My mother shared some wisdom with me at that time, that applies to every single gun death. She said that she wished that they did not publish the number of dead, because that made them anonymous and allowed people to forget that each life lost was a real human being with friends and family.

The same is true with America’s out of control gun violence. I will not add the gruesome statistics to this post because I want every reader to read Sheila Green’s name, look at her beautiful smiling face, that will smile no more — and then call or e-mail Robin Vos and Scott Fitzgerald and demand that they find some courage to pass a red flag law.

It is too late for Sheila, but it is not too late for the many lives who could be saved in the future.

I sincerely hope that the loss of Sheila’s life will gain some purpose if the Wisconsin legislature passes a red flag law. We could even call it Sheila’s Law.

Moon, sidelined from his leading role in the diplomatic effort with North Korea in 2018, said he regretted the past year’s lack of progress in negotiations.

In an annual New Year’s speech in Seoul, Moon called for new talks with Kim Jong Un, and vowed to keep up work to facilitate U.S.-North Korea communication.

“In a time of deadlock in U.S.-North Korea talks – and where we are even concerned about a step backward in inter-Korean relations – we are in desperate need of practical ways to improve inter-Korean cooperation,” he said.

He also said he would continue to push for restarting the Kaesong Industrial Complex and tours to Mt. Kumgang, and mentioned border cooperation without elaborating. He added the joint 2032 Olympics bid would be a unifying event, as would completing the inter-Korean railroad.

“We want to make an era where separation is no longer a roadblock for peace and prosperity for South and North Korea,” he said.

North Korea has been unresponsive to other recent overtures from Seoul, and cooperation projects between the neighbours have stalled in the face of international sanctions that bar most business with the North.

Pyongyang has expressed frustration at what it calls Washington’s lack of flexibility, while U.S. officials say it must take more concrete steps to dismantle its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programmes before sanctions are eased.

“The momentum for U.S.-North Korea talks must continue,” Moon said. “Provocations and threats are not helpful for anyone.”

Over the New Year, Kim said he planned to further develop nuclear programmes and introduce a “new strategic weapon” in the near future, though he signalled there was still room for dialogue with the United States.

Security and prosperity on the Korean peninsula are dependent on resolving international tensions, but the two Koreas could achieve progress through cooperation, Moon said. “I suggest South and North Korea put our heads together,” he said.",https://web.archive.org/web/20200108164013id_/https://dailytimes.com.pk/535086/south-koreas-moon-cites-desperate-need-for-ways-to-improve-ties-with-north/,,,['World']

The Chancellor tonight said the scheme, which will be open for at least three months, will cover 80 per cent of a self-employed person's average monthly profits.

But it may not be available until June and will only be available to those who have a tax return for 2019, meaning the newly self-employed will be ineligible.

And Mr Sunak warned that the self-employed could face tax hikes in the future as part of the effort to ""right the ship"" and repair the battered public finances after the coronavirus crisis is over.

Details of the scheme came as the Department of Health announced a total of 578 people who have tested positive for coronavirus in the UK have died as of 5pm on March 25.

Some 11,658 people have tested positive in the UK as of 9am on March 26.

Mr Sunak's scheme will be open to those with a trading profit of less than £50,000 in 2018-19 or an average trading profit of less than £50,000 from 2016-17, 2017-18 and 2018-19.

To qualify, more than half of their income in these periods must come from self-employment.

Up to 3.8 million people will qualify for support, with average monthly payments expected to be £940 per person.

Mr Sunak said the scheme, which will last for at least three months, ""is one of the most generous in the world"".

""It targets support to those who need help most, offering the self-employed the same level of support as those in work.""

He said the measure covers 95 per cent of people who receive the majority of their income from self-employment.

But in a hint that the self-employed could be asked to pay more to the taxman in future he said it was ""now much harder to justify"" the tax breaks on offer to the self-employed if they were receiving the same level of state support.

He said everyone would be ""chipping in together to right the ship afterwards"" once the crisis is over.

A number of self-employed workers welcomed the Chancellor's measures but expressed concern about having to wait until June to claim.

Louise Barina, a production manager who lives in London, said: ""After having spoken to our landlord, he has outright said no, that we can't get a delay on our rent.

""In terms of the payment coming in June, that's really problematic for us as that's obviously three months of payment where we need to find the money for that.""

Meanwhile the Department of Health said revising its reporting approach for coronavirus deaths ""to ensure data can be verified and published in a timely, consistent way"".

A statement on Twitter said: ""Figures issued today are recorded as of 5pm on March 24 to 5pm on March 25.

Every first of January, people set New Year’s Resolutions in the hopes of improving themselves or their lives; but how best to make them stick?

The following are a few tips to help with keeping what we resolve to do-or not do in the new year, according to experts:

1. Set intentions. An intention is a guiding principle for how you want to be, live, show up in the world and is the starting point to every goal.

2. Ask yourself why the intention or goal you set matters to you-and if it is realistic. Expectations that are too high can cause you to be too overwhelmed to start or maintain your goals.

3. Talk to people about your resolutions. This creates a support system as well as can hold you accountable.

4. Make a list of plans. Big goals can seem daunting, break your plan up into little things you can do each day to help achieve your ultimate goal.

5. Take the first step. Don’t procrastinate. You don’t need to wait until everything is just right. Get started now and make adjustments as you go along.

6. Ditch deprivation. Try not to approach your New Year’s resolutions from a place of deprivation, restriction or punishment.

7. Try not to focus on the end result. When you commit to the process of the goal, rather than the result, it’s easier to make it an enjoyable experience.

8. Take breaks. A goal should not consume your every thought and life, after all, is meant to be lived.

9. Plan for success. Instead of thinking about failing and what could go wrong, think of succeeding; put those positive thoughts out to the world. Worrying about failure is pointless and destructive.

10. Reward yourself. Celebrate your achievements, no matter how small; you deserve it!",http://westcentralonline.com/local/new-year-new-resolution-tips-to-help-achieve-this-year-s-goal,,,

Ford together with 22 state law enforcement partners, reached an agreement with PayPal Charitable Giving Fund, Inc. The agreement was created to ensure donors receive adequate information and disclosures when making charitable contributions through the company’s online fundraising platform.

PayPal Charitable Giving Fund, Inc. (PPGF) is the charitable arm of PayPal, Inc. PPGF is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit corporation that allows donors to contribute funds electronically to PPGF and select a charity that will ultimately receive the benefit of their contribution. Donors’ contributions are combined and distributed to the donors’ chosen charities. PPGF does not collect fees from donors or charities for this service; however, a charity receives contributions more quickly if the charity maintains a PayPal account, a fact that had not been adequately disclosed to donors. In some instances, PPGF redirected donors’ contributions from the charity selected by the donor to other organizations with similar purposes without informing donors.

“Charitable contributions are the financial backbone of many worthy causes,” said AG Ford. “Consumers should always have the information they need to make informed decisions about their donations. Today’s settlement with PayPal’s Charitable Giving Fund ensures every donor’s wishes are honored.”

Nationwide, charities regulators joined the effort to investigate PPGF’s fundraising activities, including its disclosures, vetting practices and treatment of charitable contributions. To address the states’ concerns, PPGF agreed to adopt reforms to its disclosures to ensure that donors know:

—That they are contributing to PPGF;

—The timeframe in which a selected charity may receive funds from PPGF; and

—The implication of being an enrolled versus an unenrolled charity on the PPGF platform.

Under the terms of the settlement, PPGF agreed to notify donors when it redirects a donor’s charitable contribution to an organization other than the one selected by the donor. PPGF will also provide regulators with future campaign data to ensure the organization is complying with its obligations under the agreement.

PPGF also agreed to make a payment of $200,000 to the National Association of Attorneys General for deposit into the NAAG Charities Enforcement and Training Fund. This Fund has been established to defray costs associated with the investigation and litigation of cases brought by state charities regulators, and to provide training and education to those regulators.

In addition to Nevada, attorneys general from the following states and territory participated in this settlement: Arkansas, Colorado, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Idaho, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New York, North Carolina Secretary of State, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania Texas and Wisconsin.

He told members of the media during a recent interview that breathalyzer testing was long overdue in Barbados, and indicated that, as a rum producer, Mount Gay wanted its products to be enjoyed responsibly.

Grisoni said it was always hurtful to see people drinking irresponsibly.

“We are also a member of an organization called the Barbados Alcohol Industry Association and what we like to see is our product being [used] responsibly and I think the breathalyzer is a good tool. . .,” he said.

In November 2019, Minister of Transport and Works Dr William Duguid announced that come January, motorists driving under the influence of alcohol will do so at the risk of being subjected to breathalyzer testing.

As he delivered remarks during a service for the United Nations’ Day of Remembrance for Road Safety Victims, Dr Duguid said his Ministry was at an advanced stage with respect to the use of breathalyzer testing on drivers.

The Minister said the introduction of such testing would go a long way in ensuring the safety of the travelling public.

Grisoni said he was not concerned that the introduction of breathalyzer testing would have a negative effect on sales for the rum-producing company.

The government has slammed critics who have likened the national lockdown to measures under apartheid rule.Addressing the media on Saturday, ministers who are part of the national command council, hit back at those finding fault with the government.This comes after the BBC ran a story which likened the lockdown, announced by President Cyril Ramaphosa on Monday, to measures taken by the apartheid government.But minister in the presidency Jackson Mthembu and social development minister Lindiwe Zulu defended the government's steps to curb the spread of Covid-19.Mthembu said the measures, which are meant to encourage South Africans to stay at home during the lockdown, were similar to actions taken by other governments worldwide.He said even South Africans had welcomed the move by government.""From what we have learnt from our people now, our people who have heeded the call by our government and our president to stay at home, to observe social distancing and to wash their hands frequently as a way to protect themselves and their families against this coronavirus say we are doing a good thing.""It's not only our people, it's also organisations that they belong to, whether political or non-governmental organisations or church organisations that we have met with the president, organisations that are in the business sector. All these organisations say that SA is doing quite a good job in protecting our people against this virus because it indeed kills,"" said Mthembu.He said the message that is being spread around the world is for people to stay at home.""Now, how would that be worse than apartheid? I have no idea ... we need to take all measure available to us to save lives,"" said Mthembu.He said when people go out of their homes, they come into contact with the disease and take it back to their homes.Zulu also slammed the comparison of the lockdown measures with apartheid.""As for the ones that say we have passed regulations that are draconian, I think those who said that have never lived under apartheid.""Those who have lived under apartheid know what I am speaking about. We have not introduced draconian laws yet because we trust that the people of SA know the crisis we are in,"" said Zulu.She said the majority of South Africans are obeying the lockdown regulations because they want to protect themselves against the virus.",https://web.archive.org/web/20210117131013id_/https://bulawayo24.com/index-id-news-sc-national-byo-182120.html,,,

5856,1625050173,['Glenn Chapman'],Snapchat curbs Trump for inciting 'racial violence',en,,,,The youth-focused social network said it would no longer promote Trump on its Discover platform for recommended content.,"Snapchat on Wednesday became the latest social network moving to curb the reach of US President Donald Trump, claiming the president has been inciting ""racial violence.""

The youth-focused social network said it would no longer promote Trump on its Discover platform for recommended content.

""We will not amplify voices who incite racial violence and injustice by giving them free promotion on Discover,"" a statement from Snapchat said.

The move came days after Twitter took an unprecedented stand by hiding a Trump post it said promoted violence, heating up the White House war with Silicon Valley and social media.

parent Snap chief executive Evan Spiegel over the weekend sent a lengthy memo to employees condemning what he saw as a legacy of racial injustice and violence in the US.

Snapchat will not promote accounts in the US that are linked to people who incite racial violence on or off the messaging platform, according Spiegel.

""Every minute we are silent in the face of evil and wrongdoing we are acting in support of evildoers,"" Spiegel wrote as companies responded to the outrage over the police killing of a black man in Minnesota.

""I am heartbroken and enraged by the treatment of black people and people of color in America.""

The Discover feature at Snapchat is a curated platform on which the California-based company gets to decide what it recommends to users.

Trump's account remains on the platform, it will just no longer be recommended viewing, according to Snapchat.

""We will make it clear with our actions that there is no gray area when it comes to racism, violence, and injustice -- and we will not promote it, nor those who support it, on our platform,"" Spiegel said in the memo.

Snapchat is particularly popular with young internet users, claiming that about half of the US ""Generation Z"" population tapping into news through its Discover feature.

""There are plenty of debates to be had about the future of our country and the world,"" Spiegel said.

""But there is simply no room for debate in our country about the value of human life and the importance of a constant struggle for freedom, equality, and justice.""

Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale denounced the move, saying that ""Snapchat is trying to rig the 2020 election, illegally using their corporate funding to promote Joe Biden and suppress President Trump.""

Parscale said in a statement: ""Snapchat hates that so many of their users watch the president's content and so they are actively engaging in voter suppression... If you're a conservative, they do not want to hear from you, they do not want you to vote. They view you as a deplorable and they do not want you to exist on their platform.""

The move by Twitter last week prompted an angry response by Trump, who within days signed an executive order calling for heightened government oversight of social platforms.

Trump accuses the platforms of ""censorship"" and limiting ""free speech,"" but his critics say the president has distorted the interpretation of those terms and is himself seeking to regulate online content.

In contrast to Twitter and Snapchat, Facebook has defended his decision not to interfere with posts by Trump.

Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg reiterated his position in a call with employees this week, according to reports, despite criticism of the Facebook policy by civil rights activists.

The coronavirus pandemic has put an abrupt stop to traditional US political means of courting young voters -- forcing presidential candidates to turn to Snapchat instead.

The photo-sending app that boasts 229 million users -- better known for filters that turn your face into a puppy or a vampire -- is a new battlefield for opponents Trump and Biden, both of whom are in their 70s.

Last month, Ken Farnaso, the Trump campaign deputy press secretary, told AFP that Snapchat was an important element of the re-election effort and that the Republican was ahead of Biden on the platform.

""It's clear that we're wiping the floor with Biden's campaign,"" Farnaso said of the Snapchat effort.

5866,1484188974,,How to free up iCloud storage space,en,,,,"Apple gives you 5GB of iCloud storage space for free, but that can feel cramped rather quickly if you have more than one iOS device to back up. Here's how to make the most of the space you have.","Lex uses a MacBook Pro, an iPhone 4S, a third-generation iPad, a Kindle 3, a TiVo HD, and a treadmill desk, and loves them all. His latest book, a children's book parody for adults, is called ""The Kid in the Crib."" Lex lives in New Jersey with his wife and three young kids. More by Lex Friedman

When Apple introduced iCloud in 2011, it announced that every customer with an Apple ID would receive 5GB of iCloud storage space for free. You can add more storage at a rate of $2 per gigabyte per year, in 10GB, 20GB, or 50GB increments. But if you’re not interested in ponying up extra cash for iCloud storage, that 5GB can quickly get tight.

That’s especially true if you use your iCloud storage allotment to back up your iOS devices. Some Apple customers find that they’re unable to back up both an iPad and iPhone to iCloud, because they don't have enough room. Does that mean you need to either pay for more storage or revert to old-fashioned iTunes backups?

Not necessarily. Instead, it means you need to exercise a little extra manual control over how you send items—and more specifically, what you send—to iCloud for safekeeping.

Once more unto the Settings app

To start, open the Settings app on one of your iOS devices, and then tap iCloud. Scroll down and tap Storage & Backup. On the screen that appears, you’ll see the total amount of storage space you have on iCloud (5GB, if you haven’t upgraded), along with the amount of space that's still unused. Beneath that is a Manage Storage button. Tap it.

At the top of the subsequent Manage Storage screen, you’ll see a list of all the iOS devices that you’re backing up to iCloud, including the current device. Examine the list closely. If it claims that you’re still backing up, say, the old iPhone 3GS that you haven’t used since before House was cancelled, you’ll want to delete its backup so that it stops gobbling up your precious storage space. Tap the unneeded device’s name, and then tap the red Delete Backup button that appears.

If you instead tap the name of the device you’re currently using, you reach a screen offering fine control over the precise items you’re backing up for that device.

The role of the Camera Roll

On that screen, you’ll see the current size of your device’s backup, along with an estimate of how large your next backup will be. Below that, you'll see a list of apps that can back up their data to iCloud. With one exception, the list appears in descending order according to the amount of space each app requires to back up its data in iCloud. The one exception: Camera Roll is always first. It isn't always the biggest item on the list, but it often is; for example, my own iPhone’s Camera Roll accounts for 1.1GB of the phone’s 1.7GB backup.

Tapping to turn off the Camera Roll brings up an intimidating question: 'Do you want to turn off Camera Roll backups and delete the backup data from iCloud?' You can choose Turn Off & Delete or Cancel. That first option is scary. If you think it means you'll lose your precious photos and videos, don't worry: You won't—or, rather, you probably won't.

By default, iCloud backs up your iOS devices’ Camera Rolls. That way, if your iPhone croaks, chokes, or otherwise gives up the ghost, you can restore from iCloud and get all your photos and videos back. If you do tap Turn Off & Delete, then, you aren't deleting those visual memories from your device; rather, you’re simply freeing up the iCloud backup space they consume, and removing the ability to restore those photos from iCloud should disaster strike your iOS device.

That isn't necessarily as risky a move as it sounds. Whenever you connect your iOS device to your Mac, you can back up its saved photos and videos to iPhoto. But even if you rarely—or never—sync your iOS devices over USB, you probably don’t need iCloud to back up your photos, thanks to Photo Stream, which keeps up to 1000 of the last photos you snapped over the past 30 days. Since the iCloud Camera Roll backup is really there only in case of emergency, and you’re likely to note a major emergency involving your iOS device in fewer than 30 days, you can generally trust that your photos are safe even if they’re not backed up to iCloud directly. (Photo Stream photos don’t count against your 5GB iCloud quota.)

Merely turning off the Camera Roll backup will shave off a significant chunk of your iOS devices’ backups. That may be enough to allow you to back up all of your iOS devices without busting the 5GB cap. But you can do even more.

Trim the app fat

Depending on how you use your iOS device, you likely will want to continue allowing some apps to back up their data to iCloud. If you frequently create documents in an iOS text editor, create songs in GarageBand, or generate any content at all, and you don’t regularly back it up (or export it in some other fashion), you should use iCloud backup for those apps.

But you probably don’t need to use iCloud to back up data from many other apps you use. And even if most of those apps account for only a few megabytes per backup per app, they can add up to a significant chunk of storage. For example, you might disable iBooks’ iCloud backup, since you can always restore your iBooks purchases from directly within the iBookstore. You probably don’t need to back up whatever data is stored by games for your kids, or games for yourself in which you don’t care about in-game progress or customizations that you might have made. And for apps that sync and back up their data on the Web—such as Instapaper—backup might be unnecessary, too.

Careful, though: Don’t turn things off willy-nilly. For example, you might think, “Hey, I don’t need to back up my data from the Cards app!” And you may well be right. But if you were to learn that, after an iCloud restore, your old photo cards were now but a memory, you'd be crushed.

Documents, data, and mail

At long last, let’s back up one level from that device-specific screen in iCloud’s settings. (Remember, though, to configure the settings for Camera Roll and other apps on each iOS device you back up.) On the main Manage Storage screen, past the list of your devices, you’ll see two other sections: Documents & Data and Mail.

The Documents & Data section refers not to the kind of content iCloud should back up, exactly; instead it refers to all those bits of data that iCloud syncs between your iOS devices (and, in some cases, your computer). This data counts against your iCloud storage allotment.

Interestingly enough, this section of iCloud’s settings can even refer to data that you saved only on your Mac. In my case, it revealed several megabytes' worth of content I’d saved in Preview while exploring; deleting those old, unneeded documents freed up a little extra iCloud space.

In addition, this section lists synced data from iCloud-leveraging apps and games. On my iPhone, that list includes Pages, Passbook, Keynote, and The Incident. I want my progress in The Incident synced between devices, and the sync data consumes just a single kilobyte, so it survives the cut. But if, for example, you see that Pages is taking up many megs (or more), you can tap it to get a listing of each document saved there, along with the amount of space it’s taking up. If you notice files you no longer need, clean ’em out.

If you use iCloud as your primary email account, you may have your work cut out for you: All that mail counts against your iCloud quota. If you don’t regularly archive email offline, prune attachments, and delete what’s deletable, Mail may gobble up an increasingly large percentage of your iCloud quota. I don’t use iCloud Mail, but I found that it was—at first—claiming about 20MB of storage space. I logged in to iCloud.com and cleared out my initial welcome message and a few other test messages to whittle that number down, though it never hit zero: I do use my iCloud account for syncing Notes between devices, and that data counts against the Mail tally, too.

Freedom can be free

Combine these tricks—disable Camera Roll backups, curate which apps get to back up their data to iCloud, limit what types of data you sync with iCloud, and prune unneeded iCloud mail—and you can dramatically shrink the space required to back up your devices with iCloud.

But if you just can’t trim enough iCloud-stored data to fit everything you need, Apple is always happy to let you pay for more space.",https://www.macworld.com/article/2010911/how-to-free-up-icloud-storage-space.html#tk.rss_all,,,"['Apple', 'iOS', 'iCloud']"

5929,1484010775,['Joan Smith'],The Cyprus case is shocking – but Britain lets down rape victims every day | Joan Smith,en,,,,"Treating women as untrustworthy witnesses is almost universal, says chair of the Mayor of London’s Violence Against Women and Girls Board Joan Smith","The message to foreign women thinking of booking a holiday in Cyprus could hardly be more stark: if you are attacked don’t expect the authorities to help you. On the contrary, reporting a rape carries a significant risk that it won’t be properly investigated, as appears to have happened to the 19-year-old British woman who went to the police in Ayia Napa in July saying she had been gang-raped. Moreover, you might end up deprived of your own liberty.

The teenager found herself convicted on Monday with inventing the whole thing, and faces a potential prison sentence when she appears at the Famagusta district court next week. Predatory young men, on the other hand, might easily come to the conclusion that they have nothing to fear.

The case now has all the ingredients of an international incident, following a highly unusual intervention from the Foreign Office. A spokesman has described events in Cyprus as “deeply distressing” and says that the UK is “seriously concerned” about the young woman’s right to a fair trial. While limiting damage to the tourist industry may have been the primary concern of the Cypriot authorities, it has backfired spectacularly. The UK is also an important ally and has military bases on the island. Whatever is being said publicly, it’s likely that frantic discussions are taking place behind the scenes, seeking a way out of what is fast becoming a public relations disaster.

It simply defies belief that more than 55,000 British women are lying about being raped every year

While some elements in this shocking case are particular to Cyprus, it highlights a culture of disbelief towards victims that is almost universal. That distrust expresses itself in different ways, depending on the jurisdiction, and it appears that the investigation in Ayia Napa was flawed from the outset. In the UK, victims often complain about the length of time a rape inquiry takes, but the Cypriot investigation was over in just 12 days. How can a thorough investigation into an alleged rape with multiple perpetrators be carried out in such a short space of time? Yet all the accused boys were released and allowed to return home to Israel.

The young woman’s legal team claim that local police failed to collect evidence from the hotel room where the incident took place, didn’t secure the crime scene and showed no understanding of the impact of traumatic events on the complainant’s memory.

Instead of treating her as a young and vulnerable witness, they interviewed her on her own late at night, with neither a lawyer nor a family member present. The Cypriot police do not record interviews, so there is no independent record of what happened during the seven hours before the teenager signed a “retraction”, which she says she did under duress.

This sequence of events is a stain on the Cypriot justice system, but what lies behind it is a hugely disproportionate anxiety about false accusations. Indeed it is one of the principal myths that undermine rape investigations, even though the idea that there are high levels of false allegations is unsupported by evidence. In the UK, a handful of widely publicised cases that ended in acquittals or a decision not to proceed to trial has tainted the entire system for investigating rape. Many people do not understand that a decision not to prosecute reflects an assessment of the available evidence, and does not mean the victim was lying.

The Crown Prosecution Service denies the accusation that it has become “risk averse”, but there has been a 52% drop in the number of rape cases prosecuted since 2016, despite an increase of 43% in complaints to the police. According to the latest figures for the year ending in March 2019, there were 58,657 allegations of rape in England and Wales but only 1,925 successful prosecutions. Unless you are a dyed-in-the-wool misogynist, it simply defies belief that more than 55,000 women are lying about being raped every year.

The truth is actually much worse: a habit of treating women as untrustworthy witnesses has imbued our own criminal justice system with a corrosive degree of suspicion. It’s far from unusual for victims to face intrusive demands for personal information, including school and medical records. They are made to feel as though they, rather than their alleged attackers, have shameful secrets in their past.

These developments have not gone unchallenged. The Centre for Women’s Justice is seeking a judicial review of the way the CPS makes decisions in rape cases, while the information commissioner is investigating a complaint from myself, the London victims’ commissioner and women’s groups about excessive demands for complainants’ private data.

In the meantime there can be no doubt that thousands of sexual predators are going free. Some of them, no doubt, will attack again. And while we rightly shudder at the treatment a British teenager has received in Cyprus, we should not forget that our own criminal justice system is in crisis – or that it lets down rape victims every day.

Straight-talking. Big-hearted. Decent. Those are some of the words used by others to describe Ken Little. He is best known for owning a long-standing fruit and vegetable store in Port Macquarie. But he is also widely respected for the huge amount of community work he does. Recently he was named our senior citizen of the year. But how much do you really know about him? What formed him and what makes him tick? Ken Little grew up on a farm at Ben Lomond near Glen Innes. He was the youngest child of 13. When he was born his father Benjamin was 67-years-old, his mother Ada only 38. His father had been left a widow with eight children with a farm to manage when his first wife died of cancer in the early 1940s. Ken's mother (who had two children of her own) was hired to work on the farm, manage the house and look after the younger children. Before long the two had fallen in love and had three more children, Jan, Benjamin and little Kenny. It was a simple childhood. On the farm he learnt the value of hard work. ""From an early age before I went to school I would milk the cows, ride or walk 5km to school,"" he recalls. ""Then after school I would round the cows up and separate the calves from their mothers so there would be milk for the next day. I also herded sheep."" The family moved to Port Macquarie when Mr Little was 10. He attended Port Primary School and Port Macquarie High School. By his own admission he was an ""average student"". But what he lacked academically he made up with other skills. ""I was always really active and independent, I played a lot of sport, fished a lot, played football,"" he said. The family didn't have a lot of money. His parents were on the old age pension. ""All the money I got I had earned from the time I was eight or nine,"" Mr Little said. ""My parents never gave me anything because they couldn't afford to."" When he was not playing sport or surfing he spent his weekends picking fruit to earn money. Towards the end of school he also began to notice girls. Mr Little met his wife Judy at the Kempsey showground when he was only 17. ""I liked her straight away, she smiled a lot, we got on,"" he said. He acknowledges it was easier to meet a partner back then but they were fortunate to find each other. When he left school he headed for Sydney like most young people. He had hoped to be a property evaluator but it didn't work out. He didn't like the city and missed the beach too much. Before long he was back in Port Macquarie, working in the fruit and veg department at Woolworths. Ironically, it was with one of his main competitors that his passion for the trade started. He set up Ken Little's Fruit and Veg in 1983. The small business originally run out of the Colonial Arcade. Disaster struck when Port Central was built. The road closures in Hay Street, loss of parking and heavy vehicle use in the area proved disastrous. ""We lost 85 per cent of our trade in a year,"" he said. ""I was stunned and devastated. I wondered if I could keep the business going and rebuild."" The business almost went bust and Judy went back to nursing to keep the family afloat. Difficult decisions were made but eventually they moved the business to Munster Street in 1996. The business started thriving but then in 2007 disaster hit again when a deliberately lit fire ripped through the store. ""Again I was thinking can I rebuild?"" he said. ""After lots of soul searching we decided to keep the business going for ourselves as we had put so much into it over the years, our staff and loyal customers,"" he said. ""We were able to gradually build the business up again and pay our bills."" The business now employs 45 staff and focuses on ""giving customers what they want"". His marriage to Judy has sustained him during difficult times. ""Like any marriage we have our ups and downs,"" he said. ""But we enjoy each other's company and we end up working things out. ""Sometimes you just need time and patience. We are different in a lot of ways, she is very artistic, and I love to watch and play sport. We don't try and change each other and the differences work."" He is proud but humble about his children's achievements. All have followed their passions. Eldest son Nigel holds a PhD in history and works for the Office of National Intelligence in Canberra. His second son Daniel is a talented former photographer. He is Ken's right hand man in the store. Daughter Naomi has travelled the world and currently lives in Denmark with her daughter working in marketing and design for an IT company. ""Do you know what the cloud is?"" he asks The Port News quizzically. Life can be difficult so how has Ken Little survived with such a sunny attitude? ""I've had a good life,"" he said. ""I try to enjoy all the simple things in life, I feel as though I live in paradise, I don't take anything or anyone for granted."" He holds fast to some principles his father taught him: ""Do unto others as you do unto yourself and if you have nothing nice to say about someone say nothing."" He is involved in a range of sporting and community groups, he has been a mentor, coach, fundraiser. What advice does he give the many young people he encounters? ""Try and stay positive,"" he said. ""When you fall down pick yourself up, remember every problem has a solution no matter how bad it is. ""Be a doer not a gonna, there are a lot of people in this world who make a loud noise that they are going to do this and going to do that but do nothing."" The Port News series is called In My Life.

5944,1519985275,,Audiencia en caso Sobornos 2012-2016 se volvió reservada para los chats privados de Alexis Mera – El Vocero Hispano,en,,,,,"Quito –

“Como nuestro marco constitucional respeta el derecho a la intimidad, usted (perito Wiliam Castro) me está hablando de comunicaciones muy personales del señor Alexis Mera… El público ajeno a este proceso debe desalojar la sala por respeto el principio de intimidad”. El presidente del Tribunal de Juicio del caso Sobornos, Iván León, se refería a conversaciones vía WhatsApp que fueron extraídas de uno de los dos teléfonos incautados al ex secretario jurídico Alexis Mera y que debían ser expuestas en audiencia por el perito solicitado por Fiscalía.

El oficial dijo que en el proceso investigativo de esta causa hizo siete informes periciales y un oficio de ampliación.

El primer informe, recordaba Castro, hablaba de que en una audiencia privada de exhibición de evidencia, de junio pasado, se verificaron dos cadenas de custodia, en las que había varios elementos, entre ellos, dos teléfonos celulares: uno marca Huawei, otro Alcatel, una tablet y un CD, todo relacionado con Mera.

La fiscal general, Diana Salazar, planteaba centrar su interrogatorio en ese peritaje y más específicamente en lo que se extrajo del Alcatel.

Según Castro, una vez que la información de ese teléfono fue analizada, Fiscalía habría dispuesto que se realice la materialización específicamente de 63 hojas, las cuales tendrían pertinencia con la investigación.

Salazar indicaba que por tratarse de información personal que corresponde a Mera y a chats de WhatsApp con el expresidente Rafael Correa y otras personas, le solicitaba al perito se centre en la información que es exclusivamente pertinente.

La defensa de Correa, Fausto Jarrín, aclaraba que Mera a la época de los chats analizados era el abogado particular del expresidente y que por lo tanto no solo debía protegerse el derecho a la intimidad, sino también la reserva que existe entre abogado y cliente.

Salazar reiteraba que no querían exponer todo lo que encontraron y le volvía a preguntar al perito si recordaba lo constante en la hoja 5 de su informe. Castro respondía que para él era casi imposible recordar entre quiénes fue la conversación y más aún el texto mismo de la conversación .

“Pido al Tribunal se me permita dar lectura a las conversaciones…”, solicitaba el perito.

Los chats que se iban a exponer, para agosto de 2019, en plena instrucción fiscal, ya eran parte del expediente del caso Sobornos. En ellos se revelaban conversaciones entre Mera y Correa, quienes vía WhatsApp hablaban de temas personales, coyuntura política y de la trama de corrupción de Odebrecht.

Más de una hora le tomó al perito explicar los chats materializados en su informe y responder las preguntas. Una vez que terminó su participación, el octavo testigo de Fiscalía, León suspendió la diligencia y convocó reinstalarala en la tarde.

La convocatoria quedó en nada cuando el secretario del juez David Jacho, quien presidirá el Tribunal que analizarán la recusación presentada por Correa en contra del Tribunal de Juzgamiento, notificó personalmente a los jueces que estaban siendo recusados. (I)

Belgian cyclist Victor Campenaerts and Namibia’s top female rider Michelle Vorster were yesterday crowned champions of the 2020 Nedbank Cycle Challenge after winning their respective categories of the annual road racing event.

Campenaerts completed the men’s 100-km road race in a time 2 hours, 11 minutes and 35 seconds to emerge victorious. The visiting Belgian finished eight minutes ahead of Nedbank Cycle Challenge two-time winner Dan Craven and Martin Freyer, who both clocked 2 hours, 19 minutes and 5 seconds.

Meanwhile, local top female cyclist Michelle Vorster won the elite women 100-km race after completing the race in 2 hours, 39 minutes and 31 seconds ahead of second-placed Jagau Imke and Dreyer Risa who both finished with a time of 2 hours, 44 minutes and 55 seconds.

Speaking to New Era Sport after the prize giving ceremony, Compenaerts, who travelled from Belgium to be part of this massive event, said the purpose of him being part of the race was to win.

“The race was intense in the beginning but as it was going, I managed to get a chance to move and stretch my lead – that’s when I got a chance to go for a kill. My purpose for taking part in this competition was because the atmosphere of the race is great and that drove me to take part. My objective to take part was to win the competition,’’ said Compenaerts.

On her part, Vorster said “I felt it was a relief after coming to the finishing line; it’s a great feeling after various years of working hard just to become number one. It’s a feeling that’s hard to explain. And also, it’s nice to see so many women take part in this competition”.

Meanwhile, the Physically Active Youth (PAY) after-school programme yesterday received a massive boost when the winners and sponsors of the men’s 100-km race donated N$54 000 to the institution.

Campenaerts said he was donating his winning prize money of N$12 000 to PAY as he was impressed with what the programme does to develop cyclists.

“Dan (Craven) told me about the project; I said I do not have any jerseys that I can give to the kids. He said I should not worry about that. So, he took me to the project and I immediately fell in love with it. So, I decided that if I win this race today, I will donate my cheque to them,” he explained.

He added that he hopes his donation will change lives at PAY, as he saw they are doing wonders in helping children with their education, while at the same time helping them enjoy their favourite sport.

Not to be outdone, Craven also donated his second prize monetary winnings of N$9 000, with third-placed Martin Freyer also adding his N$6 000. With N$27 000 donated by the winners, Nedbank Namibia Managing Director Lionel Matthews doubled the donation, saying they are inspired by what the cyclists had done.

Der sogenannte antizyklische Kapitalpuffer, der erst im vergangenen Jahr auf 0,25 Prozent erhöht worden war, wird zum 1. April auf null Prozent gesenkt.

""Mit dieser präventiven Maßnahme wird die Fähigkeit des deutschen Bankensektors gestärkt, Kredite zu vergeben"", teilte der Ausschuss für Finanzstabilität am Mittwoch mit. Das Gremium besteht aus Vertretern von Bundesfinanzministerium, Bundesbank und Bafin. Gelten soll die Regelung mindestens bis zum Jahresende.

Die Aufseher wollen Banken damit mehr Spielräume eröffnen, um Kredite zu vergeben und die von der Viruskrise gebeutelte Wirtschaft anzukurbeln.

So erlaubt die Bankaufsicht der Europäischen Zentralbank (EZB) Geldhäusern vorübergehend, Vorgaben für Kapital- und Liquiditätspuffer zu unterschreiten.

When a woman started getting wedding RSVPs to someone else’s wedding in her email’s inbox, she was initially confused. Things got complicated, however, when the bride-to-be messaged her with a strange request.

Reddit user ClockworkMoose shared their story to the site’s forums. She explained that after getting several RSVPs to a stranger’s wedding, she received an email from the bride-to-be, who shared the same first name as her. The bride-to-be said ClockworkMoose would have to give up her email account.

The story continues, “I reply to that, no, and also, why? I get an email back in about 10 minutes. She says that she's got the same first name as me, and is getting married to a guy (with the same last name as ClockworkMoose). They've picked (ClockworkMoose’s real name) as their email account for RSVPs. She didn't realize I made the account, so I can either give my password to her or I can reset it and she can create a new one, whichever works for me!”

BRIDE, GROOM EXPECT GUESTS TO SIT THROUGH TIMESHARE PRESENTATION AS PART OF DESTINATION WEDDING

When the post’s author says she declined to give up her email account, the bride-to-be responded angrily and claimed that ClockworkMoose was ruining her life and wedding.

ClockworkMoose says she eventually figured out that the bride-to-be sent out her wedding invitations with the email address on them, unaware it was already taken. Unable to recall all of the invitations, the bride-to-be seemed determined to take over the email account.

After several angry emails, ClockworkMoose says she responded and offered to forward the RSVPs to the bride’s actual email address. “She sends back a nasty email full of expletives and name-calling again demanding my password or nothing,” she wrote.

Since then, a seemingly fed up ClockworkMoose says she’s been responding to RSVPs by telling people they’re not invited to her wedding. “This has the benefit of being 100 percent true, albeit deceptive,” she wrote.

Surprisingly, this doesn’t seem to be an isolated incident. Several commenters responded by sharing similar stories that they had to deal with.

Nueva York, 20 abr (EFE).- El estado de Nueva York, epicentro de la pandemia de coronavirus en Estados Unidos, certificó este lunes su descenso del pico de COVID-19 tras registrar 478 fallecidos en un día, la cifra más baja en dos semanas, y su gobernador, Andrew Cuomo, planteó pagar un “complemento de peligrosidad”, un bonus del 50 %, a los trabajadores de primera línea.

En su actualización diaria, Cuomo señaló que el número de nuevos contagios se ha estabilizado y que están “bajando” las hospitalizaciones y entubaciones de pacientes por coronavirus, lo que invita a pensar si “ya hemos pasado el pico”, aunque aseguró que “las salas de emergencia siguen estando por encima de su capacidad”.

De acuerdo a las últimas cifras del gobernador, este domingo fallecieron 478 personas en todo el estado por complicaciones derivadas de la COVID-19, 23 de ellas en residencias de la tercera edad y el resto en hospitales, lo que supone el sexto día en descenso y sitúa la cifra total de decesos provocados por la pandemia en 14.347, una cifra que la Universidad Johns Hopkins eleva a 18.298 porque incluye los casos de las muertes domiciliarias y sospechosas de ser Covid-19.

Cuomo afirmó haber pasado de preguntarse “¿hemos pasado el pico?” a “¿cuánto tiempo vamos a estar en este nivel?” y “¿cómo de largo y abrupto será el descenso?”, para lo que las autoridades intentan prepararse con medidas de mitigación en poblaciones vulnerables y plantean recompensas a los trabajadores esenciales que han llevado el peso de la lucha contra el virus.

BONUS A LOS SANITARIOS

Cuomo también propuso un “complemento de peligrosidad a los trabajadores de primera línea” y resaltó que buena parte de ellos son negros y de piel oscura, precisamente las comunidades que “de manera más desproporcionada están siendo víctimas de la COVID-19, porque están exponiéndose” generalmente al no poder ejercer desde casa.

“El 41 % de trabajadores de primera línea son gente de color. El 45 % de los empleados de transporte, el 57 % de los empleados de limpieza, el 40 % de los sanitarios. También los repartidores y cuidadores de niños. La economía se ha cerrado para quienes tienen el lujo de poder cerrar. Dos tercios en primera línea son mujeres, y un tercio pertenecen a hogares de renta baja”, expuso.

“Mientras unos se enfrentan al desquicio de estar encerrados, ellos están saliendo y enfrentándose al coronavirus, por eso se infectan más. Propongo que se les dé un 50 % de bonus”, agregó.

LA GRAN MANZANA, EN LÍNEA

Por su parte, el alcalde de la ciudad de Nueva York, Bill de Blasio, dijo esta mañana que también allí la “situación es mejor que hace semanas” y se están haciendo “progresos”, reflejados en el descenso diario de las hospitalizaciones y el porcentaje de casos positivos, aunque el número de personas en la UCI ha repuntado ligeramente.

De Blasio afirmó que la gran urbe azotada por la crisis tiene suficientes mascarillas, viseras faciales y respiradores para la semana próxima, pero advirtió de que hay “un creciente problema con las batas quirúrgicas” y pidió ayuda al Gobierno federal para conseguir más, aunque tiene tela para fabricar 400.000 hasta el 23 de mayo.",http://laoferta.com/2020/04/20/nueva-york-certifica-la-bajada-del-pico-de-covid-19-y-plantea-un-bonus-a-los-sanitarios/,,,
6093,1483820477,,Our 2020 Vision:,en,,,,AIN takes its annual look ahead at key elements of the aviation industry,"Forgive the obvious pun, but our vision for 2020 starts here.

As a news organization, it’s AIN’s job to stick to reporting on what has already happened. One exception is this time, every year. In the following segments, you’ll read what we believe to be the outlook for key elements of our industry for the next 12 months—views inevitably shaped by the past, but with an eye toward what we believe is just beyond the immediate horizon.

You’ll get our take on the immediate future of eVTOL, not the lofty aspirations of the over-optimistic, but the cold reality; the bubbling cauldron of election-year politics as it impacts our industry; 2020’s outlook for what’s in line for the FBO industry; what’s on tap for OEMs in an ever-volatile market; avionics in the wake of the ADS-B (soft?) deadline; and what you can expect to see on the shop floors—and in the order books—of MROs.

So, how did we do last year? Here are some samples of what we were projecting for 2019:

eVTOL: “Even if eVTOLs win public acceptance and clear regulatory and technological hurdles, can OEMs and service providers deliver the technology at a price the general public can afford?” That remains the biggest open question in aviation.



Touchscreens: “It won’t be a surprise to see more manufacturers adopting this technology, especially as younger tech-savvy pilots move up the flying food chain to more sophisticated aircraft.” Twelve months later, that seems on track.

Supersonics: “Through 2019, Aerion and its partners will be initiating the process of selecting Tier 1 suppliers for the next phase of development.” This predated the February 2019 announcement of Boeing’s investment and involvement in the AS2 project. Since then, the program has gone largely silent.

Come January 2021, we’ll take another look back at this year’s look forward.",https://www.ainonline.com/aviation-news/aerospace/2019-12-30/our-2020-vision,,,

马华总会长拿督斯里魏家祥驳斥财政部长政治秘书潘俭伟对他的指控，强调由始至终不曾反对mySalam扩大至M40，并形容潘俭伟的回应犹如“转移焦点，答非所问”！

魏家祥本周三在其脸书发帖揶揄“收购大道专家”潘俭伟。魏家祥说，潘俭伟在他质疑mySalam国家健保计划的回应上，让他感到心寒和不知所措，还称除了傻眼以外，只能用“转移焦点，答非所问”来形容潘俭伟。

魏家祥也再次强调，自身对mySalam国家健保计划的立场。他说，潘俭伟一开始就指责他无所不用其极地利用各种毫无事实根据的谎言，污蔑政府协助低收入群（B40）及中等收入群（M40）的mySalam健保国家健保计划良政。

“原来在潘俭伟的逻辑里，质疑希盟的政策就是在污蔑政府，也就是说，就算希盟的政策出现弊端，人民不能质疑，因为代表人民在污蔑政府。”

魏家祥说，由始至终不曾反对mySalam扩大至M40，但是政府应该先检讨及改进该计划赔偿制度不足之处，并为低收入群体（B40）病患提供更合理的赔偿。

“就如我曾说的，B40不幸断了一只手或一只脚，是无法索赔的，因为mySalam只赔偿断了一只手及一只脚，断了双手或双脚的病患者。请问生活困苦的病人断了一只手是要自断手或脚，以便能索赔吗？不过，潘俭伟没有回答！”

魏家祥说，潘俭伟指，卫生部已经分别于2019年8月14日及今年1月13日，不下一次的发出指示函予各相关政府医院、各州卫生总监及各卫生机构，要求豁免mySalam健保索偿患者的医药报告费。

魏家祥质疑，如不是被病人揭露，mySalam的申请程序手续繁杂，B40病黎大吐口水，生活困苦的病人还要付钱向政府医院购买医药报告，但申请半年后还是石沉大海，但火箭议员却静静，那相关负责的单位会在1月13日发出指示函，要求豁免mySalam健保索偿患者的医药报告费？

他说，潘俭伟说他不了解mySalam健保计划，mySalam健保并不会让任何一造牟利，获利的只有大马人民。

他说，如果替430万人购买医药保险付4亿令吉保费，而索赔者只有区区的0.22%，索赔金额只是1370万令吉，那这有是否是公平合理的交易，而谁的牟利最多？

“对于潘俭伟指，由政府发出，所有让受保者索偿后余下的健保金，将重新循环存放入mySalam健保基金内。那为何政府宁愿把保者索偿后余下的健保金，重新循环存放入mySalam健保基金内，而不是善用它，扩大B40的受惠群体年龄层呢？说好的以民为本呢？或者已经变成以为民笨？”

魏家祥续说，对人民不知道健康关怀计划（Skim Peduli Sihat）是什么不感到意外，但是希盟或潘俭伟如果不知道或故意不知道这个计划的话，他可以再次提醒！

他说，希盟政府在509大选前，承诺一旦执政中央，他们将在全国推行已经在雪兰莪州落实的“健康关怀计划”。

他说，这项计划为低收入家庭（B40）提供每年500令吉的医疗津贴，申请者可到私人诊所享有普通病症的医疗津贴，使他们不需单单依赖距离家里很远的政府医院或诊所，这也间接减轻了政府医疗人员的负担。

“这项计划将耗资20亿令吉，而mySalam健保只是4亿令吉。但是很奇怪，现在希盟已经上台执政2年多，他们承诺的健康关怀计划呢？为什么没有兑现承诺，反而推出了mySalam健保国家健保计划？中间到底发生了什么事？难道有不可告人的秘密？”",https://eunited.com.my/356266/,,,

Trump has a MagaHatty cadre of street fascists who can disrupt Town Hall candidate meetings, his billionaires. and Putin, his Internet Hacking Agency, and Russo-American ""Businessmen Corrupters."" Winning against it will require that the Democratic party get at least 3 ""battleground states"" to adopt ranked-choice voting! The race is likely to come down to only five ""toss up"" states: Arizona, Florida, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Voters get to rank candidates in order of choice. If a candidate receives more than half of the first choices, they win, just like any other election. If not, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated, and voters who picked that candidate as 'number 1' will have their votes count for their next choice. This process continues until a candidate wins with more than half of the votes. This process is guaranteed to end with the most preferred candidate among all the votes as the winner candidate in our state situation it will produce a 270 vote electoral college. Second, rank and file democrats must, for this election only, abandon their self damaging diversity / identity theme, pitting women and minorities against each other!

We'll look at Hotel...","Today, we'll introduce the concept of the P/E ratio for those who are learning about investing. We'll look at Hotel Grand Central Limited's (SGX:H18) P/E ratio and reflect on what it tells us about the company's share price. Hotel Grand Central has a price to earnings ratio of 38.26, based on the last twelve months. That corresponds to an earnings yield of approximately 2.6%.

View our latest analysis for Hotel Grand Central

How Do I Calculate A Price To Earnings Ratio?

The formula for price to earnings is:

Price to Earnings Ratio = Price per Share ÷ Earnings per Share (EPS)

Or for Hotel Grand Central:

P/E of 38.26 = SGD1.30 ÷ SGD0.03 (Based on the year to September 2019.)

Is A High P/E Ratio Good?

A higher P/E ratio implies that investors pay a higher price for the earning power of the business. All else being equal, it's better to pay a low price -- but as Warren Buffett said, 'It's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price'.

Does Hotel Grand Central Have A Relatively High Or Low P/E For Its Industry?

We can get an indication of market expectations by looking at the P/E ratio. You can see in the image below that the average P/E (26.6) for companies in the hospitality industry is lower than Hotel Grand Central's P/E.

SGX:H18 Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 2nd 2020 More

Hotel Grand Central's P/E tells us that market participants think the company will perform better than its industry peers, going forward. Shareholders are clearly optimistic, but the future is always uncertain. So investors should always consider the P/E ratio alongside other factors, such as whether company directors have been buying shares.

How Growth Rates Impact P/E Ratios

If earnings fall then in the future the 'E' will be lower. That means unless the share price falls, the P/E will increase in a few years. So while a stock may look cheap based on past earnings, it could be expensive based on future earnings.

Hotel Grand Central shrunk earnings per share by 24% over the last year. And EPS is down 20% a year, over the last 3 years. This might lead to low expectations.

Remember: P/E Ratios Don't Consider The Balance Sheet

One drawback of using a P/E ratio is that it considers market capitalization, but not the balance sheet. Thus, the metric does not reflect cash or debt held by the company. In theory, a company can lower its future P/E ratio by using cash or debt to invest in growth.

Such spending might be good or bad, overall, but the key point here is that you need to look at debt to understand the P/E ratio in context.

Hotel Grand Central's Balance Sheet

Hotel Grand Central has net cash of S$147m. This is fairly high at 16% of its market capitalization. That might mean balance sheet strength is important to the business, but should also help push the P/E a bit higher than it would otherwise be.

The Verdict On Hotel Grand Central's P/E Ratio

Hotel Grand Central has a P/E of 38.3. That's higher than the average in its market, which is 13.5. Falling earnings per share is probably keeping traditional value investors away, but the healthy balance sheet means the company retains potential for future growth. If fails to eventuate, the current high P/E could prove to be temporary, as the share price falls.

Investors have an opportunity when market expectations about a stock are wrong. As value investor Benjamin Graham famously said, 'In the short run, the market is a voting machine but in the long run, it is a weighing machine. Although we don't have analyst forecasts you could get a better understanding of its growth by checking out this more detailed historical graph of earnings, revenue and cash flow.",https://news.yahoo.com/worry-hotel-grand-central-limiteds-024800762.html,,,

A five-judge bench of the Allahabad High Court on Monday ruled that it is not mandatory that while filling an anticipatory bail under Section 438 of CrPC, an applicant must approach the sessions court first and on rejection of the plea move to the high court.

The bench comprising Chief Justice Govind Mathur and justices Ramesh Sinha, Sunita Agarwal, Yashwant Verma and Rahul Chaturvedi observed,""Section 438 CrPC on its plain terms does not mandate or require a party to first approach the sessions court before applying to the high court for grant of anticipatory bail.""



The matter came before the bench after reference by a single judge of the court in a case related to a plea of a man named Vinod Kumar.

The single judge had referred the matter to the larger bench asking, ""Whether the Court would have no jurisdiction to reject the anticipatory bail after considering the grounds of compelling reasons mentioned in the affidavit being found not appealing, which would amount nothing but to approach this Court directly.""



The larger bench was of the view, ""We would consequently answer the reference by holding that the decision in Vinod Kumar does not merit any reconsideration or explanation. As rightly held in that decision, there can be no exhaustive or general exposition of circumstances in which an applicant may be held entitled to approach the high court directly.""



The bench further said that the special circumstances must be left for the consideration of the judge before whom the petition is placed and a decision thereon taken bearing in mind the facts and circumstances of that particular cause.

""However, special circumstances must necessarily exist and be established as such before the jurisdiction of the high court is invoked,"" it said.

CHICAGO (AP) — A former Chicago-area sheriff emerged from a crowded Republican field Tuesday in the Illinois primary, advancing to mount a long-shot challenge against Democratic U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin.

Mark Curran, who had perhaps the most name recognition of all the candidates, said he ran because he believes the political climate has changed and Durbin is vulnerable.

“He has neglected Illinois and nobody has been able to land a punch,” Curran told The Associated Press. “But having been a career prosecutor and the longest-serving sheriff in Lake County, I know how to throw a punch. I’m credible.” Durbin, the No. 2 Democrat in the Senate, was first elected in 1996 and has handily won each election since then. He also has $4.5 million cash on hand. All the other Republican candidates combined made up only a fraction of that. Curran, who led in endorsements, was previously a Democrat but switched parties in 2008. Two other candidates had also switched parties. Perennial candidate Robert Marshall, a Burr Ridge doctor, previously ran as a Democrat, including for governor. Peggy Hubbard of Belleville, a former police officer, said she became a Republican after the fatal shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, in part because of how former President Barack Obama handled it. Hubbard sparked a police investigation when she claimed during a candidate forum at a school that she brought a gun to illustrate safety lapses. Hubbard later said she misspoke. The two other Republicans were Tom Tarter, a retired cancer surgeon from Springfield, and Casey Chlebek, a Glenview man originally from Poland who works in real estate. Durbin, who was unopposed in the primary, issued a statement saying he was honored to continue the campaign and work to ""restore this nation to the honorable, decent country that we know and love.” __ Follow Sophia Tareen on Twitter: https://twitter.com/sophiatareen.

6203,1563737178,,2 more Filipinos under quarantine in Tarlac showing coronavirus symptoms,en,,,,"Two more Filipinos quarantined at the New Clark City in Tarlac are exhibiting symptoms linked to coronavirus, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III says.","Metro Manila (CNN Philippines, February 28) — Two more Filipinos quarantined at the New Clark City in Tarlac are exhibiting symptoms linked to coronavirus, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said on Friday.

The two Filipinos from the cruise ship docked in Japan due to numerous coronavirus cases, were brought to the hospital on Friday after complaining of sore throat.

Their swab tests will be sent to the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM).

DOH reported on Thursday that three other Filipinos from the ship showed flu-like symptoms. Of the three, two already tested negative. The other one who was admitted to the hospital awaits his test result from the RITM.

Duque said that if anyone from the Diamond Princess cruise ship tests positive while they were quarantined in Tarlac, it won't be considered local transmission because they most likely contracted the virus inside the vessel.

Over 700 passengers and staff of the Diamond Princess were infected during their mandatory 14-day quarantine inside the vessel docked in Yokohama.

The five who exhibited symptoms after returning to the country are part of the 458 Filipinos, mostly crew members, brought home from the ship in Japan to New Clark City to undergo another phase of quarantine.

All those under quarantine are monitored twice a day to see if any of them would develop flu-like symptoms. Once any of them would exhibit signs and symptoms, they would be immediately referred to designated hospitals.

Seventy Filipino crew members of the Diamond Princess who tested positive for the coronavirus remain admitted in hospitals in Tokyo, Japan. Eight of the 10 who have recovered returned to the Philippines and were placed under monitoring, Duque said.

The Philippines has only three confirmed cases of coronavirus. Two have recovered, while one died.

There are only 30 patients under investigation.

""We are observing a steady decrease in the number of PUIs (patients under investigation) admitted in our health facilities and DOH is bent on sustaining this downward trend.

Las comunidades de todas partes del mundo cancelaron eventos públicos con la esperanza de frenar la propagación.

Prestando testimonio ante el Capitolio, el médico Anthony Fauci, director del Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Alérgicas e Infecciosas, alertó que el brote en Estados Unidos va a empeorar.

“Puedo decir que tendremos más casos y que las cosas empeorarán mucho más de lo que están ahora”, comentó Fauci a la Comisión para la Supervisión y Reforma del Gobierno de la Cámara de Representantes. Mientras enfrentaba preguntas de los legisladores, Fauci explicó: “Es 10 veces más letal que la gripe estacional”. La audiencia fue interrumpida abruptamente cuando él y otros funcionarios de alto rango se regresaron a la Casa Blanca para reuniones.

Tras días de señales confusas y diferencias partidistas, Washington consideró una acción.

“¡Estoy completamente preparado para utilizar todo el poder del gobierno federal para manejar nuestro desafío actual del coronavirus!”, tuiteó Trump. Añadió que realizaría “una declaración” en las próximas horas, alrededor de las 8 de la noche (hora del Este).

Entre otras medidas, los funcionarios consideraban emitir una recomendación de viaje de “nivel 3” sobre toda la Unión Europea. Dicho aviso recomendaría a los estadounidenses que eviten los viajes no esenciales a la región y ponerse en cuarentena por 14 días tras regresar a casa.

Sin embargo, había confusión en la Casa Blanca, pese a que los funcionarios empezaban a comprender la enorme gravedad de la situación. El vicepresidente Mike Pence se reunió con directores de hospitales y líderes de la industria de salud en la Sala Roosevelt, pero los reporteros que se habían reunido para observarla no fueron invitados a ella.

En tanto, Trump se reunía con banqueros para discutir cómo la industria de servicios financieros puede ayudar a los clientes y pequeños negocios que se han visto afectados por el brote.

“El gobierno de Trump sigue con su agresivo enfoque integral al tiempo que dirige una estrategia de todo el país para que funcionarios de salud pública, instituciones académicas, organizaciones no gubernamentales y al sector privado protejan a los estadounidenses”, informó la Casa Blanca.

La presidenta de la Cámara de Representantes Nancy Pelosi planeaba presentar un paquete de ayuda económica sobre paga por enfermedad y otras medidas para ayudar financieramente a aquellos que se pusieron bajo cuarentena o faltaron al trabajo mientras las autoridades alentaban a la gente a limitar sus interacciones sociales para frenar el aumento de infecciones. La votación podría llevarse a cabo el jueves.

Luego de que los legisladores de ambos partidos rechazaron la suspensión de los impuestos sobre la nómina propuesta por Trump, surgió una unión bipartidista con el fin de elaborar un paquete de la Cámara de Representantes, que podría enfocarse en cuestiones más inmediatas, como pago por enfermedad, prestaciones de desempleo, pruebas gratuitas y otros recursos para los estadounidenses afectados por la crisis.

""Die Solidarität zwischen Spaces und Nutzern ist groß."" Oftmals hätten die Verträge eine Kündigungsfrist von einem Monat. Solange sie weiterlaufen, gebe es nur geringe wirtschaftliche Auswirkungen. Problematisch für die Betreiber seien hingegen die vielen Absagen von Veranstaltungen oder Buchungen von Meetingräumen. Dadurch würde ein nicht unerheblicher Teil der Einnahmen wegfallen.

Der Verband befürchtet zudem, dass trotz der Solidaritätsbekundungen der Nutzer eine Schließung der Räume über längere Zeit zu Kündigungen führen könnte. Das würde die Betreiber laut Kollewe in eine finanzielle Schieflage bringen. Schon jetzt hätten einige Anbieter ihren Betrieb bis Ende März zur Sicherheit runtergefahren. Es dürften etwa keine Gäste mehr empfangen werden und Meetingräume blieben geschlossen, um eine Ansteckung mit dem Erreger Sars-CoV-2 zu vermeiden.

Auch der globale Coworking-Spaces-Anbieter Wework schränkt nach eigenen Angaben seinen Betrieb in Deutschland seit dieser Woche ein. So wurden zum Beispiel Veranstaltungen abgesagt und aus Hygienegründen Einweg-Geschirr zur Verfügung gestellt. ""Zusätzlich weisen Schilder in unseren Gebäuden darauf hin, einen Abstand von 1,5 Metern zu anderen Mitgliedern zu halten"", sagte eine Sprecherin. Wework ist in Deutschland nach eigenen Angaben mit 15 Standorten in Hamburg, Berlin, Köln, Frankfurt und München vertreten.

Verbandschef Kollewe zufolge würden in einigen Fällen Unternehmen ihren Mitarbeitern Coworking-Spaces als Alternative zum Homeoffice anbieten. Die Betreiber müssten dann sicherstellen, ""dass die Hygienestandards eingehalten werden, dass Datenschutz und Datensicherheit eingehalten wird."" Die Mitarbeiter könnten dann entscheiden, ob sie lieber von dort oder von zuhause arbeiten wollen.

Die Bundesregierung hatte am Montag den Ländern im Kampf gegen die Ausbreitung des Coronavirus vorgeschlagen, eine Vielzahl von Geschäften zu schließen. Supermärkte und andere Läden, die zur Versorgung der Menschen dienen, sollen demnach allerdings offen bleiben. Der Bundesverband Coworking Deutschland vertritt nach eigenen Angaben 100 von rund 450 Anbietern in Deutschland./sb/DP/zb",https://www.boerse-online.de/nachrichten/aktien/virus-roundup-trotz-corona-coworking-spaces-nutzer-lassen-vertraege-weiterlaufen-1029006572,,,

The signs of life are a few: stray cats and dogs and a handful of families furtively piling their belongings into vehicles as they evacuate their homes.

The town sits near the epicentre of the 6.4 earthquake that rocked Puerto Rico on Tuesday – the worst tremor to hit Puerto Rico in a century – which killed at least three people and left thousands homeless. Large-scale aftershocks, including one of 6.0 magnitude on Saturday morning, have rocked the island ever since.

Related: Puerto Rico counts cost of worst earthquake in a century – in pictures

“I’ve never experienced anything like this,” said Edith Muñiz, 55, a lifelong resident of the town.

“Many have fled their homes,” Muñiz said, standing in front of a Presbyterian church where emergency supplies were being collected. Across the street lay the ruins of a school whose three floors had pancaked flat on one another. (Luckily, the students were still off on winter break.) “We’re living here without water and without light.”

The quakes are the latest in a string of shocks for this island of 3.2 million people – a commonwealth of the United States whose residents are US citizens but cannot vote in US presidential elections and have no voting representation in the US Congress. The island is still reeling from the impact of 2017’s Hurricane Maria – which devastated the island and killed at least 3,000 people – and processing protests last summer which forced the then governor, Ricardo Rosselló, from office.

As after Maria, the response of the US government has appeared unfocused and disconnected. And – as after Maria – local officials have given varying and contradictory information about the island’s power grid. On Satuday, at least 20% of the island’s customers were still without power.

After this latest tragedy, many in Puerto Rico wonder if the powers that lord over them – local or federal – have learned anything from recent history.

“The root of the problem remains unchanged,” saids Manuel Natal Albelo, 33, a representative in the commonwealth’s House of Representatives who will be running for mayor of the capital San Juan this fall under the banner of the Movimiento Victoria Ciudadana (MVC), an insurgent political party formed shortly before this past summer’s protests.

“It is the corruption of a two-party system that responds exclusively to benefit particular financial interest groups,” Natal continued. “From the policies to the individuals in charge of their implementation, the old political establishment still sacrifices the vast majority of our people to protect the privileges of a few.”

Rosselló eventually resigned after a series of profane chats were leaked in which he and close advisers mocked ordinary Puerto Ricans. His hand-picked successor, Pedro Pierluisi, lasted just five days before the island’s supreme court forced him out, citing questionable terms of succession.

Pierluisi was succeeded by Wanda Vázquez, the island’s justice secretary. She claimed no political aspirations herself, but quickly warmed to the role, announcing last month that she would run for a full term in office, in the primaries of the ruling Partido Nuevo Progresista (PNP), which favours Puerto Rico becoming a US state.

The PNP dominates the island’s bicameral legislature, while the opposition Partido Popular Democrático (PPD) – which favours a continuation of commonwealth status – maintains a slim majority of the mayor’s office. The parties have dominated Puerto Rico for decades.

Vázquez has enacted as series of populist measures, including streamlining the process for owning firearms (a questionable initiative in an island with a dire rate of gun crime and femicide) and signing a bill that affirmed the legality of cockfighting, in defiance of a US ban.",https://web.archive.org/web/20200114143127id_/https://news.yahoo.com/puerto-rico-earthquakes-just-latest-110033519.html,,,

Coronavirus patients will be given the blood of survivors of the deadly disease as part of a new treatment being trialled at London’s Guy’s and St Thomas’ hospitals.

More than 6,500 people have signed up for the trial, which will begin in “the coming weeks”, the hospitals' Biomedical Research Centre said.

Donations have already been collected from 148 people in England, with the hope being that transfusions will boost the struggling immune systems of Covid-19 sufferers.

The potential treatment, variants of which have long been used to fight other infections, uses the liquid part of the blood, known as convalescent plasma.

The hospitals said if the trials proved it to be effective, NHS Blood and Transplant will begin a national programme to deliver up to 10,000 units of convalescent plasma per week to the National Health Service, enough to treat 5,000 patients each week.

The trial is co-led by Dr Manu Shankar-Hari, a consultant in intensive care medicine at the hospitals, along with experts from NHS Blood and Transplant and the University of Cambridge.

“As a new disease, there are no proven drugs to treat critically ill patients with Covid-19. Providing critically ill patients with plasma from patients who have recovered... could improve their chances of recovery,” said Dr Shankar-Hari.

Health and Social Care secretary Matt Hancock said: “This global pandemic is the biggest public health emergency this generation has faced and we are doing absolutely everything we can to beat it.

“The UK has world-leading life sciences and research sectors and I have every hope this treatment will be a major milestone in our fight against this disease.

“Hundreds of people are participating in national trials already for potential treatments and the scaling up of convalescent plasma collection means thousands could potentially benefit from it in the future.”",https://uk.news.yahoo.com/coronavirus-patients-given-blood-survivors-175808154.html,,,

ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. — New Year’s Eve revelers can expect a chilly end to 2019.

But no travel problems are expected — at least through much of New Year’s Day.

A storm system moving in from the northwest could make things a little slick New Year’s night into Thursday. National Weather Service meteorologists said accumulating snow is expected in the western and central parts of the state, especially in the northern mountains. An accumulation of an inch or less is predicted for the Albuquerque metro on Thursday, with a little more than an inch expected in Santa Fe. A few additional inches are possible in the northern mountains. Rain mixed with snow is expected to spread across the eastern plains on Thursday.

Cold temperatures are expected to remain throughout the week, with a possible warming trend coming during the weekend. Temperatures are expected to be between 5 to 10 degrees below normal Tuesday into Wednesday. The weather service is urging residents to protect pipes, pets and plants over the next couple days. Highs in the 40s and lows in the mid and low 20s are expected through the remainder of the week in the Albuquerque metro. Low temperatures are expected to be in the teens or single digits in northern New Mexico.

Roads are expected to be slick in the western part of the state and in the northern mountains Wednesday night into Thursday. Gusty winds could also make travel hazardous along the I-40 corridor in eastern New Mexico.

Cold, drier weather is expected Friday, with warmer temperatures Saturday and much of Sunday before another storm system moves across the state bringing more chances of snow late Sunday into Monday.

6478,1484233982,['December'],The left’s constant victimhood olympics is a gift to anti-Semites,en,,,,"The answer: Because the country is seized by the politics of victimhood, and there’s nothing that self-pitying “victims” find easier than blaming Jews for their misery.","Police have arrested a 38-year-old black man from Orange Country, NY, for stabbing five Jews in the home of a Hasidic rabbi in Monsey on the seventh night of Hanukkah. If you’re a New Yorker or a Jew or both, you’re asking why. Why has yet another African-American attacked Jews? Why has black-on-Jewish assault become a continuous feature of life in and around New York? Why now?

The answer: Because the country is seized by the politics of victimhood, and there’s nothing that self-pitying “victims” find easier than blaming Jews for their misery.

The names given to the bogeymen of today’s populism are all historical code words for Jews. On the populist right, this means the elite, the globalists and the media. On the populist left, it’s Wall Street, the wealthy and the 1 percent. If that isn’t enough, the left has also decided that Jews — a minority who make up 2.2 percent of the American population — are “hyper-white” and, in Marxist terms, actually part of the power structure that keeps minorities down.

It’s no secret that right-wing populism has facilitated a violent, sometimes deadly, rise in Jew-hatred, but it’s forbidden to draw similar conclusions about the populist left. At least in public. There are two reasons for this: First, pointing out the problem on the right is a means of attacking President Trump. Second, addressing the problem on the left would mean facing the outsize role that black Americans have played in recent attacks against Jews.

On the first point, it is not only wrong to blame Trump for right-wing anti-Semitism, it’s perverse. How anyone gets away with claiming that the president doesn’t condemn Jew-hatred is beyond me. He condemns it at every turn. He devoted an unprecedentedly large chunk of his last State of the Union address to denouncing anti-Semitism and vowing to fight it wherever it may arise.

Trump recently moved to crack down against anti-Semitism on college campuses (and was denounced for it as a racist by the left). For his commitment to fighting Jew-hatred and his unfaltering support of Israel, he has earned the enmity of far-right anti-Semites.

On the second point, the facts speak for themselves. Throughout 2019, African-Americans attacked Orthodox Jews in Brooklyn on a more-or-less weekly basis, and it barely ever made the mainstream news. It wasn’t until two members of the Black Hebrew Israelites shot up a kosher market in Jersey City in early December that the media was forced into acknowledging reality.

The left’s leading populists have fetishized the victim status of certain minorities, including African Americans. They have made slavery and its legacy the focal points of American life. They have determined, without evidence, that police are on a campaign to kill unarmed blacks. And they speak generally as if we have suddenly been transported to a pre-civil-rights-movement America.

What’s more, unlike Trump, some of the left’s leading populists have gone out of their way to steer their followers toward blaming the Jews. The stand-out figures here are Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar and Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib. Their public record of blaming Jewish money for corrupting American politics is so well-known that it needs no rehearsing here. And it has either been ignored or defended by the larger left. If you called either of them out on their anti-Semitism, you were charged with racism and misogyny. Omar so petrified Democratic leaders that they couldn’t even pass a House resolution condemning her blatant anti-Semitic remarks.

But the problem on the left goes beyond Omar and Tlaib. And it goes beyond the rest of the Squad, who engage in constant anti-Israel theatrics. It stretches to the identitarian populism of most of the 2020 Democratic candidates for president, to the liberal garment-rending over the defeat of the anti-Semitic Jeremy Corbyn, to the intersectional gobbledygook that divides college campuses by ethnicity, to the Women’s March activists who embrace Louis Farrakhan and down to the community level, where, for example, the NAACP’s Passaic branch posts Facebook rants blaming tainted water supplies on the Jews.

Historically, indulged victims have needed no encouragement in pointing their finger at Jews. Telling them that others are responsible for their woes has usually been enough to get them headed in that direction. But some on today’s left have given Jew-hatred an extra nudge. Their winks, dog-whistles and outright calumnies have served as a noxious propaganda campaign and led to a surge of minority anti-Semitism. With the attempted murders in Monsey, this can no longer be kept a secret, and maybe those who have facilitated it will begin to know a little shame.

Wie die US-Botschaft in Peking am Samstag mitteilte, kam ein mit dem Virus infizierter 60-jähriger US-Bürger in der besonders schwer betroffenen Stadt Wuhan am 6. Februar ums Leben. Welches Geschlecht das Opfer hat, ließ die Botschaft offen.

Auch ein Japaner starb in Wuhan, wie Japans Außenministerium mitteilte. Demnach handelte es sich um einen Mann in seinen 60ern, bei dem eine Infektion mit dem Virus vermutet wurde. Der Patient habe an einer schweren Lungenentzündung gelitten.

Die Zahl der nachgewiesenen Infektionen und der Toten durch das Virus stieg bis Samstag erneut kräftig an. Die Zahl der Patienten, bei denen das Virus nachgewiesen wurde, kletterte innerhalb eines Tages um 3399 auf 34 546. Das teilte die Gesundheitskommission in Peking mit.

Die neu nachgewiesenen Infektionen nahmen damit im Vergleich zum Vortag wieder zu, nachdem sie in den vergangenen zwei Tagen leicht zurückgegangen waren. Auch die Zahl der Toten legte erneut deutlich um 86 auf 722 zu. Allein die Provinz Hubei, wo das Virus ursprünglich in der Metropole Wuhan ausgebrochen war, meldete 81 neue Todesopfer. Außerhalb von Festland-China gibt es in mehr als zwei Dutzend Ländern über 270 weitere Fälle, davon 14 in Deutschland.

Am Wochenende möchte die Bundesregierung weitere Deutsche mit einigen Angehörigen aus Wuhan zurückholen. Es gebe dort ""einzelne Personen"", die sich erst nach dem Rückholflug am vergangenen Samstag gemeldet oder es nicht rechtzeitig zum Flughafen geschafft hätten, hieß es aus dem Auswärtigen Amt am Donnerstagabend. ""Wir bemühen uns intensiv darum, auch diesen Personen eine Ausreise zu ermöglichen."" Insgesamt sollen etwa 20 Menschen nach Deutschland kommen. Möglicherweise können sie mit einer größeren Gruppe von Briten ausfliegen. Sie sollen laut ""Spiegel"" in einer Klinik in Berlin-Köpenick in Quarantäne kommen.

Wegen der neuen Lungenkrankheit hatte die Bundeswehr bereits Anfang Februar Deutsche und ihre Angehörige mit einer Sondermaschine aus der stark vom Coronavirus betroffenen Stadt Wuhan zurückgeholt. Rund 120 Passagiere des Fluges sind seit ihrer Rückkehr in einer Kaserne im pfälzischen Germersheim in Quarantäne. Bei zwei Passagieren war das Virus festgestellt worden. Die Isolation ist auch deshalb nötig, weil die Erkrankung bis zu zwei Wochen nach der Infektion ausbrechen kann.

Unterdessen ist die Zahl der positiv auf das Coronavirus getesteten Personen an Bord eines unter Quarantäne gestellten Kreuzfahrtschiffes im japanischen Yokohama um 3 auf 64 gestiegen. Das teilte das japanische Gesundheitsministerium am Samstag mit. Eine Person befinde sich in einem kritischen Zustand. Neben den bisher bekannten Fällen seien zwei Amerikaner und ein Chinese positiv getestet und in Krankenhäuser gebracht worden. Die Quarantäne der ""Diamond Princess"" mit rund 3700 Passagieren und Crew-Mitgliedern gilt laut japanischen Behörden vorläufig bis 19. Februar.

Die chinesische Sonderverwaltungsregion Hongkong verstärkte am Samstag ihre Bemühungen, eine Ausbreitung des Virus zu verhindern. Die Behörden verhängten eine Pflicht-Quarantäne für alle Reisenden vom chinesischen Festland. Demnach müssen Hongkonger, die aus China zurückkehren, für 14 Tage zuhause bleiben. Andere Besucher können die Zeit in Hotels absitzen. Mit Tracking-Armbändern soll demnach überprüft werden, ob die Quarantäne eingehalten wird.

Doctors are not optimistic one of the men stabbed at a New York Hanukkah celebration will regain consciousness, according to the victim’s family.

Josef Neumann, who was one of five people assaulted Saturday in the upstate hamlet of Monsey, suffered multiple stab wounds to his head, neck and arms, his family said in a statement posted to social media by the Orthodox Jewish Public Affairs Council. Shoshana Bernstein, a spokeswoman for the Orthodox Jewish community in Monsey, said the statement is accurate.

“Doctors are not optimistic about his chances to regain consciousness, and if our father does miraculously recover partially, doctors expect that he will have permanent damage to the brain; leaving him partially paralyzed and speech-impaired for the rest of his life,” the statement said.

The family described Neumann’s condition as dire and said a weapon “penetrated his skull directly into the brain.” His right arm was shattered.

“Our father has seven children, many grandchildren, a great grandchild, and brothers and sisters,” the statement said.

“We shall not let this terrible hate-driven attack be forgotten, and let us all work to eradicate all sorts of hate.”

Yisroel Kraus, who was a guest at the home of the rabbi where a man wounded the victims with a machete, described Neumann as a mentor and an “incredibly kind human being.”

“One of the most selfless people I know,” Kraus told CNN. “Since I knew him he was a very poor man. He never had a dime to his name and always goes around collecting money for other poor families. It was never about himself.”

Another survivor was hit in the side of the head by the suspect’s machete and doctors had to use three staples to close his wounds, Rabbi Shmuel Gancz told CNN Tuesday.

Shloime Rottenberg, the son of Rabbi Chaim Rottenberg, had just finished the ceremony of lighting the menorah at his father’s home when the attack started, Gancz said.

“They are grateful for what they deem a minor injury considering where else the machete could have hit him, such as his eyes,” Gancz said of Rottenberg and his family.

Authorities identified the suspect as Grafton Thomas, 37. He pleaded not guilty to five counts of attempted murder Sunday. A day later, he was charged by federal agents with obstruction of free exercise of religious beliefs involving an attempt to kill — a federal hate crime. A judge ordered him to be detained.

Federal prosecutors said Thomas entered the rabbi’s home in Monsey, north of Manhattan, on Saturday night and told the dozens of people there “no one is leaving.” He attacked them with an 18-inch machete, with at least five victims suffering injuries ranging from slash wounds to a severed finger and a skull fracture, federal prosecutors said.",https://krdo.com/news/national-world/2020/01/01/one-of-the-ny-hanukkah-stabbing-victims-may-not-regain-consciousness-his-family-says/,,,

On day seven

Creator grew restless

And sadly contemplated

All He had made that must be undone

And then He began to pack up thing within thing

Time He reversed

So for a millisecond the whale

Walked again

And the primal mud

Was once again Creator's pride and joy



On day six the rivers He stopped from flowing

The tides He stilled

The sea surge He quieted with a look

The wind He stopped it from blowing

The storm He calmed

The funnel He summoned it back

Into the purple cloud



On day five He paused to watch the horses

Running across the plain

He laid His palm across their wildness

And they collapsed and slept

The herd a heap

And He saw that it wasn't good



On day four

The colors of the world He muted

The stars He blew out of the sky

The sun He extinguished

The mountains flattened

The sea He drank

And all the waters of creation

He sucked them dry fountain and spring

The fires of the middle earth

He snuffed just like a candle



Day three

All the creatures He had named

He orphaned them

He took their names back

So all of life was nameless

The sea and sky He joined back together

So the fish and birds of the sky

Looked at each other in a long moment

Of awkward recognition

And two by two all living things

Feathered, scaled, naked and creeping

Paraded from His memory

Like fleeting images from a magic lantern



Day two

Energy He withdrew from matter

So that wood and bone and metal and flesh

Were all the same in His eye

And spirit He removed from energy

And He saw that it was not good



On day one

He stopped

Because all His work was undone

He allowed His sadness to spread into a great silence

And into this silence

Into this sadness He stole Himself away

And was no more

6563,1504564783,,The annexation of the West Bank is coming,en,,,,,"We are about to witness the third Israeli election in the space of one year.

The elections for the Knesset, Israel’s parliament, which are coming in March, are being held after the failure of anyone to either score an overall majority or to forge a coalition government.

Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, is holding on for now. His far-right coalition won the most seats in the last election in September, but it was not enough to form a government with a majority.

It is possible that the Blue and White party could win the next election – they actually came one seat ahead of Netanyahu’s party, Likud, in the last election.

READ: US opposes Israel annexation of West Bank before peace plan revealed

But even if they did, so what? For the Palestinians, all Zionist parties in Israel mean the same thing: continuation of the daily, grinding, violent reality of Israeli racism and occupation.

The West Bank is under the boot of Israel’s military dictatorship. Palestinians who dare challenge it are indiscriminately beaten, tortured, abused, have their homes demolished or are even murdered by the Israeli military and settlers.

The Gaza Strip is under constant siege, and the brave unarmed Palestinian demonstrators trying to break out of it since 2018 have been shot down dead by brutal Israeli snipers.

The Palestinians inside ‘Israel’ – the Palestinian territories occupied by Zionist forces, starting in 1947 – are not full citizens of the state. By law and by practice, they have far fewer rights than Jewish citizens of Israel. Israeli courts have consistently ruled for decades that there is no such nationality as ‘Israeli’ and that the state belongs to Jews alone.

Finally, the Palestinian refugees outside Palestine still languish for long decades inside their camps – being denied their most fundamental right to return to the homes they were expelled from.

READ: Netanyahu vows to annex all settlements ‘without exception’

But this totally unjust situation is not enough for Israel – both the state and society wants more.

As I wrote at the time, in the last election, at least 89 per cent of Israelis voted for parties whose policy it was to continue the occupation of the West Bank – military dictatorship with no rights, remember – indefinitely.

And now, with the third election looming, Israel’s two leading parties, Likud and Blue and White, are both ramping up their threats to formally annex large parts of the West Bank.

The West Bank and the Gaza Strip together consist of only 22 per cent of historic Palestine, as it was at the time that the British occupation ended in 1948.

So, 78 per cent is not enough for Israel still. They want it all.

While it seems unlikely for the time being, that they could get away with a mass expulsion, ethnic cleansing-type-event as they did in 1948, victory for Zionism looks like this: maximum land, minimum Arabs.

So, in working towards this end, Israel has been slowly, in the decades since it occupied the remaining 22 per cent, absorbing the entire West Bank through the creation of “facts on the ground”.

#IsraElex19: Israeli Elections 2019 Everything you need to know >>

These “facts” are a slow-motion ethnic cleansing. Palestinian homes are declared to have been built “without permits” (impossible in many areas, since Israel almost always denies such permits to Palestinians – even while granting them to Jews) and are thus destroyed. Industrial-scale colonies for Jews are then built on the ruins.

Annexation will be the formal, post-facto legitimisation of such blatant criminality in Israeli law – and it looks set to be supported by the US.

President Donald Trump has already done this in the case of the Golan Heights. This is a Syrian territory, illegally and violently invaded and occupied by Israel in 1967. Yet Trump (urged on by his number one campaign funder, Sheldon Adelson, a casino billionaire and important US Israel lobbyist), decided to formally recognise the “legality” of this outright criminality – just as he did in moving the US embassy to Jerusalem.

So there really was no doubt that the most pro-Israel US president would ever give the green light to any annexation move in the West Bank, even before the latest second-hand reports from anonymous Israeli sources emerged about the latest version of Trump’s ‘deal of the century’.

In the forthcoming election, both main Israeli parties are attempting to outdo one another on how much Palestinian land they can steal, clear out of its Palestinians, and then annex for the purposes of building Israeli colonies.

Last election, Netanyahu promised to annex the Jordan Valley, and Blue and White’s Benny Gantz (a former general), indicated he’d agree to the same.

Now this election, Netanyahu is talking about annexing as much as 40 per cent of the West Bank, while Gantz is now promising to steal the entire Jordan Valley (the part of the West Bank that borders Jordan).

Annexation, then, is coming. Will this finally spell the long-forecast collapse of Israel’s collaborationist entity, the Palestinian Authority? Time will tell.

One thing is for sure: this situation will not hold indefinitely. Five million Palestinians are being denied even their most basic human rights – systematically, by design of Israel’s racist laws. This cannot be indefinitely sustained.

6579,1531251283,['Senior Politics Reporter'],Bernie Sanders Targeted Again And Again In Chaotic Democratic Debate,en,,,,The Vermont senator drew most of the attacks onstage in Charleston. But it might be too late to stop his march to the nomination.,"CHARLESTON, S.C. ― Bernie Sanders finally got the front-runner treatment at Tuesday’s Democratic presidential debate, a combative and messy affair that put his rivals’ urgency on display as polls show the Vermont senator solidifying his support in South Carolina and in other states across the country.

After skating by largely unchallenged in last week’s debate in Las Vegas, Sanders drew repeated attacks over his past votes against gun control, the feasibility and cost of his proposals, what his nomination might mean for down-ballot Democrats running for office in November, reports that Russia might favor his campaign, his comments about Fidel Castro’s Cuba, and his opposition to eliminating the filibuster.

But with Super Tuesday and its many key primaries only a week away, Sanders’ rivals may have waited too long to challenge him onstage and in television ads across the country. And as much as they tried to focus on Sanders, they couldn’t resist getting distracted by squabbling among themselves.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), for example, decided to run over former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg one more time, calling him out for supporting Republicans for Senate, including in Pennsylvania, South Carolina, and her own state of Massachusetts. And she again excoriated the billionaire self-funder over his alleged treatment of his former female employees.

Former Vice President Joe Biden, meanwhile, went after billionaire environmentalist Tom Steyer, who is threatening Biden’s support from Black voters in South Carolina. Biden whacked Steyer over his hedge fund’s millions of dollars of investments in the nation’s leading private prison corporation.

But it was Sanders who drew most of the attacks on Tuesday, as he noted onstage.

“I’m hearing my name mentioned a little bit tonight. I wonder why,” the senator quipped at one point.

In a shift, Warren launched her most direct attacks on Sanders yet. The two progressive champions have largely avoided going after each other in the 2020 race, but her path forward after South Carolina’s primary on Saturday is far less secure than that of Sanders.

The Massachusetts senator called out Sanders early on in the debate, saying she would “make a better president than Bernie” because of how she handled questions about “Medicare for All” and its implementation.

“It’s going to take someone to dig into the details to make it happen,” Warren said of her ‘Medicare for All’ plan, voicing frustration at the reaction from Sanders’ campaign. “I dug in, did the work, and Bernie’s team trashed me for it.”

Bloomberg whacked Sanders over reports that Russia is trying to help his campaign. “That’s why Russia is helping you get elected, so you’ll lose to [Donald Trump],” he said. But the senator gave as good as he got, criticizing Bloomberg over his past praise of China’s President Xi Jinping.

“I’m not a good friend of President Xi of China,” Sanders said. “I think President Xi is an authoritarian leader, and let me tell Mr. Putin, who tried to interfere in the 2016 election and tried to pit Americans against each other: Hey, Mr. Putin, if I’m president, trust me, you won’t interfere with any more elections.”

Biden slammed Sanders for past votes against gun control measures in the 1990s, including the Brady Act, which mandated federal background checks and a waiting period for some handgun purchases. Though Sanders now supports gun control measures, Biden said the 2015 church massacre in Charleston, which took place mere feet away from the debate stage, may have not have happened if stricter gun control measures were in place.

“I’m not saying he’s responsible for the nine deaths,” Biden said of Sanders, “but that man would not be able to get that weapon without a waiting period,” he added, referring to the shooter.

Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, the other moderates in the race, hit Sanders over the cost of his health care and economic proposals.

“The math does not add up,” Klobuchar said of Sanders’ plans.

Buttigieg, meanwhile, argued that nominating a self-described Democratic socialist would hurt Democrats’ chances at flipping the Senate and defending their House majority in November.

“Let’s do some math ... It adds up to four more years of Donald Trump,” Buttigieg warned about a potential Sanders nomination.

He also pressed Sanders on the filibuster and his opposition to rewriting the Senate’s longstanding supermajority rule on legislation. “How are we going to deliver a revolution if you won’t even support a rule change?” Buttigieg asked.

Warren piled on, saying that “people like Bernie” have “given a veto” to the pharmaceutical and insurance industries by refusing to call for an end to the filibuster.

Sanders didn’t give an inch, staying on-message as he has in past debates. He said he would pay for his proposals through a tax on the wealthiest Americans, as well as some tax increases on the middle class he said would be offset by lower health care costs. The biggest misconception about his campaign, he added, is that “the ideas I’m talking about are radical. They’re not.”

The senator also defended his recent comments in which he praised aspects of Fidel Castro’s government in Cuba. “I have opposed authoritarian governments all over the world,” Sanders said Tuesday, arguing that they deserved praise when they do something right.

It’s not clear if Tuesday’s unorganized assault on Sanders will be enough to deny his path to the Democratic nomination, however. With the moderate lane in the race split between several candidates, Sanders is currently projected to take a huge lead in the delegate-rich Super Tuesday states ― a lead that may be irreversible after next week.

Sanders’ campaign summed up the decidedly chaotic debate with an email subject line that will only help his cause with his most ardent supporters: “US against everyone.”",https://www.huffpost.com/entry/bernie-sanders-charleston-debate_n_5e55dca5c5b6fc7a9e36cf2a,,,"['2020 election', 'Democratic Primary', 'Presidential Debates', 'We All Belong', 'Bernie Sanders', 'Politics', 'Extremism', 'The State of Abortion', 'Democrats', 'Social Justice', 'Joe Biden', 'Congress', 'HuffPost Press Room', 'Coronavirus']"

An eyewitness has described his version of events that lead to the shooting of eight people in Melville, Johannesburg, in the early hours of Wednesday morning.

Two people were killed and six others were wounded when unknown suspects opened fire on a popular restaurant on 7th Street.

Two of the injured are in a critical condition in hospital.

Gauteng police are calling for anyone with further information on the drive-by shooting to come forward.

An eyewitness says a fight ensued before people were shot at randomly.

“It was not the first time that there was shooting randomly with a car that is unknown, unregistered, unmarked. It was just a fight, three coloured guys and one black guy. They fought and dispersed, went to Liquid Blue and the other clubs. The fight happened here. These guys came back here and shot randomly. They shot anyone and anybody that didn’t know a thing,” describes the eyewitness.

‘Negative impact on business’

A business owner in Melville, Johannesburg has expressed shock over the shooting incident. Walter Niemand owns a Bed and Breakfast with his wife, not far from where the shooting took place.

He says he fears that the incident will have a negative impact on their business and it may also affect international tourism.

“We are all affected and it’s not just us as business people but it’s also for Melville, Johannesburg and the country. At the moment, we have guests from Holland, obviously, it won’t make a good impression and they will tell their family and friends in Holland what they had experienced here,” explains Niemand.

‘Residents terrified’

Residents of Melville say crime in their area has gotten out of hand and they are terrified. Some residents describe how they are feeling following the shooting.

“Obviously we are shocked at what goes on around here. Melville is a really vibey area and it’s full of these beautiful and fun restaurants. Why do people want to come with aggression and just grab guns and shoot others? This is what happens in Melville, certain places operate as restaurants and they do not have entertainment licenses but they have loud music and DJs up to 3 in the morning. I never imagined there would be killings and injuries down the road from where I live,” residents say.

Crosses last fiscal’s figure with 67 days to spare this year

Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) has increased its share of the first-year premium income in the first nine months of this fiscal. LIC’s share rose to 70.52% from 66.24% recorded in 2018-19.

“During the current fiscal, our market share improved in terms of first-year premium income. We have crossed last year’s collection of ₹1,42,000 crore in total first-year premium, 67 days ahead of the schedule,” Mukesh Kumar Gupta, managing director, LIC, said.

LIC also crossed ₹1 lakh crore in first year premium in the Pension and Group Insurance vertical for the first time. Mr. Gupta added that the insurance major had ₹32 lakh crore in assets and ₹29 lakh crore in investment. Recently, it had paid dividend of ₹2,611 crore to the Centre.

As of December, LIC had posted a growth of 17.81% in number of policies sold and 45.56% in first year premium income.

According to Mr. Gupta, LIC had set itself a target of ₹56,000 crore in individual business premium and ₹1.25 lakh crore for the pension and group insurance scheme for FY20. Together with renewal income of about ₹2 lakh crore, LIC would be gunning for the ₹4 lakh crore-mark this fiscal, he said. For FY21, LIC plans to increase the number of insurance agents from 12 lakh to 15 lakh. In this regard, it had already recruited officers and development officers. About 8,000 assistant officers would be placed soon.

On NPAs, he added that LIC’s net non-performing asset (NPA) ratio stood at 1% for the current fiscal, despite major defaults by some corporate borrowers. “We are doing well on all counts. Most loans are given through consortium and the consortium partners are working on it,” he said. Asked about the recovery mechanism, he said: “Provisions have been fully made and efforts are on to recover bad debts. ”

On banking subsidiary IDBI Bank, he expressed optimism that it would come out of the Prompt Corrective Action framework by March 2020.

Mit 7,02 Euro waren sie vor dem Wochenende noch auf ein neues Tief in der schweren Pandemie-Krise abgesackt. So steht der Flug- und Reiseverkehr weltweit größtenteils still.

Der Strom negativer Analysten-Kommentare reißt indes auch zum Wochenauftakt nicht ab. Mit Johannes Braun vom Investmenthaus Mainfirst stapelt ein weiterer Experte mit seinem auf 2,50 Euro gekappten Kursziel sehr tief. Auch Malte Schulz von der Commerzbank signalisiert mit seinem auf 4,50 Euro gesenkten Ziel noch deutliche Risiken.

Zunächst konzentrierten sich die Anleger aber auf eine mögliche Finanzspritze des Staates. Bei dem diskutierten Hilfspaket gehe es um ein Volumen von neun bis zehn Milliarden Euro, erfuhr die Deutsche Presse-Agentur am Wochenende aus Regierungskreisen. Zum Vergleich: an der Börse bringt es die Lufthansa aktuell gerade einmal noch auf einen Marktwert von 3,7 Milliarden Euro.

Kurz vor der Entscheidung sind auch neue Hilfen für den Ferienflieger Condor. Geplant sei ein Spitzengespräch zwischen Kanzlerin Angela Merkel (CDU), Finanzminister Olaf Scholz (SPD), Wirtschaftsminister Peter Altmaier (CDU), Verkehrsminister Andreas Scheuer (CSU) und Lufthansa-Chef Carsten Spohr.

Erst am Donnerstag hatte der Konzern eingestanden, dass man sich nicht mehr aus eigener Kraft aus der Corona-Krise retten könne. Die Anleger reichten die Papiere daraufhin noch eiliger in Richtung des absoluten Tiefs vom März 2003 bei 6,80 Euro durch./ag/mis/jha/

Der wirtschaftliche Schock durch die Pandemie scheine der größte in der Geschichte zu sein, und auch die finanzpolitische Antwort darauf sei die schnellste und größte in der Nachkriegsgeschichte, sagte Powell am Mittwoch bei einer Video-Schalte mit einem Thinktank in Washington. Die bisherigen Pakete seien aber womöglich nicht das letzte Kapitel. Weitere politische Maßnahmen könnten notwendig sein.

Auf Nachfrage bekräftige der Fed-Chef die Position der Notenbank, wonach das Konzept negativer Leitzinsen für die US-Wirtschaft eher ungeeignet sei. Zumindest zum jetzigen Zeitpunkt ziehe die Fed den Einsatz des Instruments nicht in Betracht. Powell reagierte damit auf zunehmende Spekulationen an den Finanzmärkten, wonach die Fed anderen Notenbanken folgen und ihren Leitzins unter die Nulllinie senken könnte. Ähnlich gehen derzeit etwa die japanische Notenbank oder die Europäische Zentralbank (EZB) vor.

""Zusätzliche fiskalische Unterstützung könnte kostspielig sein, lohnt sich aber, wenn sie dazu beiträgt, langfristige wirtschaftliche Schäden zu vermeiden und uns eine stärkere Erholung zu bescheren"", sagte Powell. Diese Abwägung sei Sache des Kongresses. Langfristig müsse das Land wieder zu einer nachhaltigen Haushaltsführung zurückkehren. Dies müsse aber in wirtschaftlich guten Zeiten passieren. Derzeit sei dies keine Priorität.

Die Notenbank werde ihre Instrumente weiterhin vollumfänglich einsetzen, bis die Krise eindeutig überstanden sei, sagte Powell. Der Weg dahin sei aber höchst ungewiss und mit erheblichen Risiken verbunden. Die wirtschaftlichen Folgen der Corona-Krise seien wesentlich schlimmer als jede Rezession seit dem Zweiten Weltkrieg. Die Notenbank hat ihre Geldpolitik in der Corona-Krise bereits beispiellos gelockert.

Zu konkreten Vorschlägen aus dem US-Parlament mit Blick auf weitere Konjunkturpakete wollte sich Powell nicht äußern. Dies gehöre nicht zur Rolle der Fed, betonte er. Der US-Kongress hat seit März bereits Konjunkturpakete in Höhe von rund 2,7 Billionen US-Dollar auf den Weg gebracht. Die Demokraten im Repräsentantenhaus fordern wegen der anhaltenden Krise ein weiteres Paket im Umfang von mindestens drei Billionen US-Dollar.

Die Haltung der Regierung des Republikaners Donald Trump ist es, dass nun zunächst die Wirkung der bisher verabschiedeten Gesetze abgewartet werden müsse, bevor über weitere Maßnahmen nachgedacht werden könne. Nancy Pelosi, die demokratische Vorsitzende des Repräsentantenhauses, mahnte dagegen am Mittwoch im Interview mit dem Sender MSNBC: ""Dies ist nicht die Zeit für eine Pause."" Die US-Wirtschaft befindet sich wegen der Pandemie in einer schweren Krise./jac/bgf/jsl",https://www.boerse-online.de/nachrichten/aktien/roundup-fed-chef-powell-weitere-corona-konjunkturhilfen-koennten-noetig-sein-1029198160,,,

Google plans to implement new limitations in its Chrome web browser after discovering certain ads overuse CPU and data resources, costing users device battery life and money.

Announced in a post to the Chromium blog on Thursday, Google's restrictions target ads that ""consume a disproportionate share of device resources"" without user knowledge.

Chrome Product Manager Marshall Vale says a future update to Chrome will limit the resources poorly coded ads like cryptocurrency miners have access to before user interaction. Initially, Chrome is setting restriction thresholds to 4MB of network data or 14 seconds of CPU usage in a 30-second period. Alternatively, ads will be limited after 60 seconds of total CPU usage.

An ad frame will be redirected to an error page if it reaches one of the above thresholds, with the page informing users that said ad used too many resources and was therefore removed from active display.

According to in-house measurements, only 0.3% of current ads exceed the stipulated thresholds. Still, those ads account for 27% of network data used and 28% of all ad CPU usage on Chrome. The figures underscore the need for intervention.

Ad creators can view Chrome's access reports to see which ads were unloaded due to the new restrictions and make necessary adjustments.",https://appleinsider.com/articles/20/05/15/chrome-to-limit-resource-hog-ads-by-august,,,
6772,1620631185,,Tory MPs urge shortening of two-metre rule,en,,,,"Boris Johnson is being asked to adopt a 1.5m rule to prevent large-scale redundancies, particularly in the hospitality sector. | ITV National News","Senior Conservative MPs are reportedly urging Boris Johnson to change the two metre social distancing rule to one-and-a-half metres to prevent large-scale redundancies.

While the Prime Minister spoke this week in favour of the two-metre gap, The Daily Telegraph said concerns are building that thousands of hospitality industry workers who have so far been unable to return to work could be laid off unless the rule is relaxed immediately.

Greg Clark, chairman of the Commons Science Committee and the former business secretary, has reportedly written to Mr Johnson urging him to relax the rule in light of new evidence.

“The difference between two metres and 1.5 metres may seem small but it can be the difference between people being able to go to work and losing their jobs,” Mr Clark told the paper.

Former Brexit secretary David Davis said alterations to the Government-backed furlough scheme should be implemented “in-step” with a relaxation of the two-metre rule.

He said some firms would be unfairly disadvantaged if they had to remain shut due to the two-metre rule while being forced to start paying towards staff costs again under changes to the furlough plan.

“What will happen is that they will shut, meaning the furlough money is wasted, and there will be no tax revenue from that business,” Mr Davis was quoted as saying.

The Telegraph said Mr Clark cites in his letter a new paper from the Scientific Advisory Group on Emergencies (Sage) which says it may be possible to “enable distancing at less than two metres” in certain areas, provided other Covid-19 control measures are implemented.

Highlighting parts of the document which suggest droplet exposure and infection risk “fall sharply at 1.5 metres”, Mr Clark said the paper did not appear to “establish the need for a recommended distance of two metres”.

The push to review the rule conflicts with the latest advice from the country’s coronavirus experts on Thursday.

England’s chief medical officer Professor Chris Whitty and the Government’s chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance suggested two metres was still necessary as the risk of spreading the virus remained too great.

Sir Patrick said: “It’s not an absolute (that) beyond two metres is safe and slightly less is not safe, there’s a graduation across that, and so roughly at a metre it’s somewhere between 10 and 30 times more risky than at two metres.”

Professor Whitty said it was “really important” that people stayed two metres apart when meeting outside, adding they would not be counted as a contact, and therefore would not need to self-isolate if someone they met at a distance then developed coronavirus.

Prof Whitty, who said keeping the distance would ensure the risk remained low, added: “If you do maintain two metres distance and the contacts you’ve had turn out subsequently to have coronavirus, you will not be counted as a contact and you will not have to self-isolate.

“On the other hand, if you don’t, then if they get coronavirus then a) you might get it and b) because you might have got it, it’s likely that you’ll have to self-isolate.”

Mr Johnson on Thursday agreed with his scientific advisers, saying: “I must stress that to control the virus, everyone needs to stay alert, act responsibly, strictly observe social distancing rules, and stay two metres apart from those who you do not live with.”",https://www.itv.com/news/2020-05-30/tory-mps-urge-shortening-of-two-metre-rule/,,,"['Ukraine', 'Climate', 'Coronavirus']"

6879,1531088087,"['Yamiche Alcindor', 'Meredith Lee']",WATCH: Steyer says NDAs should not be a presidential debate focus,en,,,,"Tom Steyer, qualified for the 10th Democratic debate after increasing his poll numbers in South Carolina, told the PBS NewsHour that attacks against Michael Bloomberg over the nondisclosure agreements are a distraction.","CHARLESTON, S.C. — Presidential candidate Tom Steyer says he is hoping that when Democrats meet on a debate stage Tuesday, they focus less on arguing over nondisclosure agreements and personal wealth, and more on taking on President Donald Trump. The investor and activist qualified for the 10th Democratic debate after increasing his poll numbers in South Carolina, which holds its primary Saturday.

Steyer’s comment highlights the backlash faced by the other billionaire Democratic candidate in the race, Michael Bloomberg, over his history of having at least three former female employees sign nondisclosure agreements related to alleged offensive comments he made. During the last debate, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., pointedly criticized Bloomberg for the agreements and accused him of buying his way onto the stage through a blitz of political advertising.

Steyer, who didn’t qualify for the last debate, told the PBS NewsHour that spending time discussing nondisclosure agreements are a distraction.

“The attitude you have towards women matters,” Steyer said. “If you could show that there was something really wrong, that really matters. But something that says, ‘There could have been something wrong,’ and they have a nondisclosure agreement– I don’t think that rises to the level of a presidential debate.”

Steyer said he felt that Trump “won” the last debate because “people spent their time talking about minor, irrelevant points to try and tear each other down, when in fact the real question is, what you are going to do for the American people that’s different and better?”

After Steyer poured millions of dollars of his own personal wealth into running ads and hiring campaign staff in South Carolina, he said he, too, expects to be attacked by some candidates over his affluence.

“I’m not going to apologize for being a success,” Steyer said. “If I were a person who is totally self-absorbed and selfish, then I’d have something to be embarrassed about. I’m not embarrassed about starting a business, succeeding in a business and using everything I can to try and work for the American people. That’s exactly what I’m doing.”

Early on in its history, his hedge fund invested in fossil fuels and private prisons– two sectors criticized by many Democrats. When asked if those investments were a mistake, Steyer affirmed that it was, and that he had corrected it on his own by disinvesting in those industries. “I really care about these issues,” he said, adding that attacks based on that history “are low political blows.”

A poll released Monday by NBC news and Marist shows former Vice President Joe Biden leading in South Carolina with 27 percent of support. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, currently seen as the Democratic front-runner, is just four points behind. Steyer is in third place with 15 percent.

WATCH: Buttigieg vows to focus on diversity ahead of South Carolina

To Steyer, criticism of his spending in South Carolina is offensive to the black voters who make up the majority of Democratic primary voters in the state — and with whom he has made inroads.

“We’re out here renting rooms and hiring people to work,” Steyer said of his campaign operation. “Every time somebody hires a black person and they go into a community, somehow that’s buying influence. No one ever says that when you go and hire white people.”

Steyer said that “the implication is that black people are there to be bought and that we’re trying to do it, that’s not true,” he said. “That’s what you do when you organize politically. You get people from the community, you hire staff in the community so you can work in the community.”",https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/watch-steyer-says-ndas-should-not-be-a-presidential-debate-focus,,,"['Brooks and Capehart', 'Supreme Court', 'Race Matters', 'ScienceScope', 'Long-Term Care', 'south carolina', 'tom steyer', ""Teachers' Lounge"", 'vote 2020', 'Politics Monday', 'democratic debates', 'Innovation and Invention', 'Basic Research', 'Essays', 'The Leading Edge']"

LAS VEGAS — The Ducks didn’t have a chance Tuesday afternoon because they didn’t give themselves a chance. They tossed the puck around like it was toxic and paid the price for their carelessness with a 5-2 loss to the opportunistic Vegas Golden Knights at T-Mobile Arena.

The Golden Knights jumped the Ducks from the start, and it wasn’t as if they needed help to build a commanding lead. But the Ducks gave it to them anyway, sandwiching two egregious turnovers around an own goal as Vegas skated away with a 3-1 advantage entering the third period.

Funny thing, too.

The Ducks actually weathered an early Vegas onslaught to take a 1-0 lead on defenseman Korbinian Holzer’s first goal of the season, a chip shot that found the back of the net 8:13 into the game. It was more or less, all downhill from there for the Ducks.

“It’s frustrating when we come out and we’re not ready to play,” Ducks goaltender John Gibson said. “It’s a privilege to play in the National Hockey League and it feels like some guys are starting to take it for granted and are just kind of happy to be here. We play a good game every now and then and we can’t string it together, put two in a row, can’t seem to get points.”

Gibson turned away the Golden Knights again and again, but he was left to fend for himself far too often. Vegas outshot the Ducks by 43-28, including 22-5 in the first period.

“We’ve got to find a way to be more consistent in our game,” Holzer said. “There are stretches in the game where we play really well and there are stretches where we play absolutely terrible. We can’t have ‘Gibby’ bail us out every night. It’s not the way we should play. It’s not a recipe for success.”

The rest of the opening period unfolded in a nightmarish fashion of the Ducks’ own making.

Ducks defenseman Erik Gudbranson lost control of the puck in front of his net. Mark Stone, who separated Sam Steel from the puck a nanosecond earlier, jumped on Gudbranson’s misplay and beat Ducks goaltender Gibson for the tying goal at 14:36 of the first period.

Vegas then made it 2-1 in the closing seconds of the opening period. Or rather the Ducks did. Alex Tuch was credited with the tiebreaking goal at 19:40, when he swatted a loose puck beneath Gibson. The puck kept moving and then Ducks defenseman Josh Manson tapped it into his own net.

The Ducks complained that a whistle should have halted play, but to no avail. Gibson later said he watched the replay during the intermission and admitted the call was correct. He even skated out and spoke to referee Dean Morton before the second period began.

Ducks ride second-period flurry to victory over Golden Knights “It was just kind of sitting there,” Gibson said of the loose puck that ended up squirting free before Manson mishandled it. “I think Manson went to grab it and it went into the net. I was upset with it and then I looked at it and (Morton) made the right call.”

Late in the second period, after the Ducks had pushed back and actually began to generate sustained pressure in the Golden Knights’ end, disaster struck again. Adam Henrique’s clearing attempt sailed directly onto the stick of Vegas’ Reilly Smith, who beat Gibson for a 3-1 lead at 17:55.

In the third, Jonathan Marchessault scored twice, including on a penalty shot that extended the Vegas lead to 4-1. Jakob Silfverberg’s team-leading 14th goal cut the Ducks’ deficit to 4-2, but Marchessault sealed it with an empty-net goal with 1:54 left.

“It would be one thing if we had shown all year that we weren’t able to play with teams like this, but we have shown that we can,” Ducks coach Dallas Eakins said. “That’s where you kind of (hurt) yourself. It’s like if you go out and run a four-minute mile and you show up every day after that and you run a seven-minute mile. Something’s wrong because you showed you could do it.”

7015,1484702889,['Shawn Johnson'],Elections Panel Deadlocks Again on Voting List Purge,en,,,,"While court decision ordering purge appealed, state elections commission’s members evenly divided by party.","Get a daily rundown of the top stories on Urban Milwaukee

The Wisconsin Elections Commission deadlocked again Monday on what to do next after a circuit court judge ordered the state to purge more than 200,000 names from Wisconsin’s voter registration list.

It’s the second time in less than a month that the commission, which is split evenly between Republicans and Democrats, has been unable to agree on how to address the court order by a circuit court judge.

That original order has since been appealed and a new lawsuit has been filed in federal court attempting to block it.

Elections Commissioner Mark Thomsen, one of the panel’s Democrats, said those lawsuits should be allowed to play out before the voting rolls are changed.

“It would seem to me premature and wrongheaded for the commission to jump ahead,” Thompson said

Earlier this month, Ozaukee County Circuit Judge ruled in favor of plaintiffs in a lawsuit filed by the conservative Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty , known as WILL. They argued that the Wisconsin Elections Commission was violating state law by not removing thousands of people from voting rolls who were suspected to have moved.

The voters were identified by what’s known as the Electronic Registration Information Center (ERIC), a nonprofit, multi-state system that helps member states keep their voter registration lists current. ERIC identifies people who may have moved after they file official paperwork with another government agency like the Department of Motor Vehicles.

The Elections Commission voted earlier this year to send a mailing to more than 230,000 voters stating that they’d been flagged as having moved. But the commission’s original mailing also told voters that they would not be automatically removed from the state’s registration rolls until 2021.

At the time, the Elections Commission argued that state law gave it discretion on whether to immediately rescind a voter’s registration. It said that discretion was necessary given the state’s previous experiences with the ERIC system in 2017, when voters who had not moved were mistakenly tossed off the rolls.

Malloy rejected that argument, ruling on Dec. 13 that the state must remove the names from Wisconsin’s voter rolls immediately.

Wisconsin’s Elections Commission met just days later, voting 3-3 on Dec. 16 on a motion that would have immediately purged the state’s voter rolls. With the commission’s even split, a bipartisan vote is required to accomplish anything.

The Wisconsin Department of Justice, led by Democratic Attorney General Josh Kaul, appealed the initial ruling in state court, and WILL asked the Wisconsin Supreme Court to take the case directly.

At the same time, the Wisconsin League of Women Voters filed a new lawsuit in federal court in an attempt to block the initial ruling.

Republican Dean Knudson, a former GOP state lawmaker who chairs the Elections Commission, said Monday that he felt it was important for the commission to take action following the court order by Malloy.

“We are under a court order from the circuit court in Ozaukee County to follow the law,” Knudson said. “I wish the law was clearer. But I feel like we need to do our best to follow the law.”

But the commission’s Democrats, like Ann Jacobs, said the system used to flag voter names was flawed and it was unclear if the state even had the authority to remove people.

“The right to vote is of such power that the idea that we’re going to simply kick people off the rolls because of a poor data match is astonishing,” Jacobs said.

The case is being closely watched because of Wisconsin’s potentially pivotal role in the 2020 election and its recent history of close finishes.

For example, the 2019 Wisconsin Supreme Court race and the 2016 race for president were both decided by margins of less than 1 percent, and the 2018 race for governor was decided by just over 1 percent.

7066,1595032489,,Boris Johnson and Carrie Symonds name son in tribute to doctors who saved PM,en,,,,Wilfred Lawrie Nicholas Johnson was born on Wednesday.,"Boris Johnson and Carrie Symonds

Boris Johnson and Carrie Symonds have named their son Wilfred Lawrie Nicholas Johnson, in a tribute to their grandfathers and the doctors who helped save the Prime Minister’s life.

Ms Symonds, 32, posted a picture of her cradling the newborn on Instagram on Saturday, saying she “couldn’t be happier” and that her “heart is full”.

She praised the maternity team at University College Hospital in London, who she said “looked after us so well”.

Ms Symonds and Wilfred are understood to be back in Number 10 with Mr Johnson.

The couple announced on Wednesday that she had given birth to a baby boy earlier that day.

It came just weeks after Mr Johnson was discharged from intensive care where he had been battling coronavirus. Ms Symonds also suffered symptoms of the disease.

She wrote in her Instagram post: “Introducing Wilfred Lawrie Nicholas Johnson born on 29.04.20 at 9am.

“Wilfred after Boris’ grandfather, Lawrie after my grandfather, Nicholas after Dr Nick Price and Dr Nick Hart – the two doctors that saved Boris’ life last month.

“Thank you so, so much to the incredible NHS maternity team at UCLH that looked after us so well. I couldn’t be happier. My heart is full.”

Mr Johnson, who is currently grappling with the Covid-19 crisis, is expected to take a “short period” of paternity leave later in the year.

The new family are planning to live in their Downing Street flat along with their dog Dilyn, Downing Street has said.

The baby’s first name is a tribute to Mr Johnson’s paternal grandfather, Osman Wilfred Kemal, later Johnson, whose father, an interior minister of the Ottoman Empire, was killed in the 1922 Turkish War of Independence. His mother, Winifred, died in childbirth.

Professor Marcel Levi, chief executive of University College London Hospital, congratulated the couple on the birth of their son.

He added: “I would like to thank the teams who cared for Carrie and her baby. They are an incredibly skilled, dedicated and compassionate group of professionals who put patients at the heart of everything they do.

“I am very proud of them and all our staff at UCLH who are working extremely hard in very difficult circumstances at the moment.” ​

In February, the couple announced they were expecting a baby in “early summer” and that they had become engaged at the end of 2019.

They made history as the first unmarried couple to officially live together in Downing Street when they moved in last summer, after Mr Johnson won the Conservative Party leadership contest.

The new arrival is the third baby born to a serving prime minister in recent history.

Clapping again for our tremendous carers tonight and wishing hero @captaintommoore a very happy birthday. I also have another wonderful reason to thank the NHS this week too ? Thank you so, so much! ????????? — Carrie Symonds (@carriesymonds) April 30, 2020

“We need to do much more than we ever thought it was possible,” Mr Grossi said in the message recorded as part of the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) 20 Leaders Campaign to mark the day. “With radiotherapy we kill tumors, with radiotherapy we ease pain, but in one-third of low- and middle-income countries there is a lack of radiotherapy treatment. Twenty-eight countries in Africa lack a single radiotherapy unit. In these countries a cancer diagnosis is often almost as a death sentence. This must change.”

Radiotherapy is one of the most widely used therapies for cancer treatment, but access to this cost-effective treatment option is limited, or non-existent, in many parts of the world. With a growing cancer incidence worldwide, the need to make radiation medicine more widely available is pressing, particularly in the developing world.

“Take breast or cervical cancer, these are easily treatable and curable in rich, industrialized nations,” Mr Grossi said in his message, highlighting that this not the case in poor countries, where 300,000 women die of cervical cancer every year. “This is a scandal. This must stop. The IAEA is ready to make radiotherapy treatment available in more countries,” he said.

The IAEA helps countries establish nuclear and radiation medicine services, from resource mobilization to the procurement of equipment and training of medical professionals.

The Agency will mark World Cancer Day at its headquarters with an event on Friday, 7 February, focusing on the role of nuclear and radiation medicine in the fight against cervical cancer.

A goat is seen in Llandudno as the spread of coronavirus continues Llandudno, Wales, UK, March 31, 2020. [Reuters]

A herd of Kashmir goats have invaded a Welsh seaside resort after the coronavirus lockdown left the streets deserted.The animals, who normally roam free on a nearby headland jutting out into the Irish Sea, have instead wandered into Llandudno where they have spent the past three days feasting on garden hedges and flowers. Like other countries affected by the global coronavirus crisis, the United Kingdom has imposed strict social distancing measures including shop and school closures, and the authorities are asking everyone to stay at home except for essential travel. With the streets of Llandudno unnaturally quiet, the goats have been free to wander the streets undisturbed. Town councillor Carol Marubbi said the goats didn’t normally come into town unless the weather was awful, but on this occasion she said they probably realized something unusual was going on because there were so few people around. “I think they’re probably feeling a bit lonely and they have come down to have a look around,” she told Reuters by telephone. Kashmir goats have lived on the Great Orme promontory near Llandudno since the days of Queen Victoria, when the species became popular in Britain due to a fashion for shawls made from their soft cashmere wool.

Marubbi said the herd of about 150 goats, some of whom had kids in February, were a well-known local attraction and most residents did not mind having their hedges nibbled by them. “I’m a big fan,” she said. “I love them because they are characters.” With millions of people stuck at home sharing light-hearted content online to alleviate the tedium of the lockdown, images and video of the goats roving around the streets were a hit on social media, with #goats and #Llandudno trending on Twitter. “Just love this.

Strafatto di alcol e droga, spaccava tutto. Ha ferito 5 militari, ma poi è stato sedato, ricoverato e arrestato per droga, resistenza e lesioni

I militari del Nucleo operativo e radiomobile della Compagnia Carabinieri di Merano hanno arrestato uno straniero trentatreenne per detenzione di droga, resistenza a pubblico ufficiale e lesioni.

Intorno alle ore 11 di mercoledì i carabinieri sono stati chiamati a intervenire presso un’abitazione tra via Wolf e via San Francesco a Merano ove era stata segnalata una lite.

I militari hanno trovato un marocchino, ospite di una coppia di meranesi, che stava spaccando tutto sotto l’effetto di alcol o droga.

La centrale operativa dei carabinieri di Merano ha anche dovuto mandare sul posto una seconda pattuglia poiché era impossibile contenere l’uomo fuori di sé.

Nel frattempo anche un’autoambulanza è giunta sul posto.



Dopo una violentissima colluttazione (cinque carabinieri contusi di cui due con ferite da morso…) e la somministrazione di un sedativo, carabinieri e sanitari sono riusciti a far salire l’uomo sull’ambulanza e accompagnarlo all’ospedale. Qui è stato ricoverato sotto osservazione.

I carabinieri nel frattempo hanno perquisito la stanza dove alloggia il marocchino e hanno trovato quindici grammi di cocaina, un bilancino elettronico, materiale per il confezionamento delle dosi di droga, 780 euro in varie banconote e tre telefoni cellulari.

L’uomo - un 33enne marocchino nullafacente - è stato dimesso e condotto in caserma ove è stato sottoposto a rilievi foto-dattiloscopici e quindi accompagnato in stato di arresto al carcere di Bolzano.

È indagato per i reati di resistenza a pubblico ufficiale, lesioni personali aggravate e detenzione di stupefacenti ai fini di spaccio e attenderà il giudizio di convalida dietro le sbarre.

It’s method? The building of mass camps that can hold millions of people. All throughout the country, the regime is setting up “quarentine centers” to hold those anyone thought to be infected with the virus.

Work has already started on the camp in Wuhan, where the virus originated

The virus originated in the domestic economic capital of Wuhan, a city of millions of people. It spread rapidly though and has now killed dozens, and infected thousands across the country. It is also appearing in places outside of China, across the globe.

Beijing is using the same strategy it used to combat SARs virus. That virus 17 years ago has taught the Chinese regime much about virus control.

Construction of the special hospital with a capacity of 1,000 beds for patients with #nCoV2019 has begun in Wuhan, according to the model of the hospital built in seven days in Beijing to deal with #SARS in 2003. The construction is scheduled to be completed by February 3. pic.twitter.com/MtVgIG0liC — People's Daily, China (@PDChina) January 24, 2020 Around the clock work is being conducted on the Wuhan ground zero camp

China is now taking precautionary measures by establishing quarantines throughout all of China. In Hong Kong for example, a quarantine center being established was firebombed by protesters who have been protesting for the past year. It was not even previously known to the world that China was setting up a quarantine center in Hong Kong, which is hundreds of miles away from where the virus supposedly is.

A growing number of businesses and individuals worldwide have stopped using banknotes in fear that physical currency, handled by tens of thousands of people over their useful life, could be a vector for the spreading coronavirus.

Public officials and health experts have said that the risk of transferring the virus person-to-person through the use of banknotes is small. But that has not stopped businesses from refusing to accept currency and some countries from urging their citizens to stop using banknotes altogether.

Open Books, a non-profit bookstore in Chicago, sent an email to customers last week asking individuals not to use cash. A chain of diners in Washington State has also stopped accepting cash. And delivery services like Grubhub, Door Dash, and others have instituted “no contact” deliveries, and have either stopped offering cash as a payment option or are actively discouraging it.

Experts say cash does carry a risk of transmitting the virus, but the risk from cash so far is small compared with other transmission routes. A scientific paper published early in the outbreak found the virus can live on cardboard for up to 24 hours and up to three days on plastic and stainless steel. The researchers, however, did not test whether it can live on banknote paper.

The presence of live virus particles on banknotes does not mean they are a health hazard, public health experts said. Virus particles are unlikely to return to the air, or aerosolize, once on a surface.

“It’s not impossible that there might be traces of virus on dollar bills but if you wash your hands it should provide adequate protections, you shouldn’t need anything else,” said Julie Fischer, a professor at the Center for Global Health Science and Society at Georgetown University, on C-SPAN.

Other devices used to pay for items are just as likely to be vectors for disease transfer. Credit and debit cards are made of plastic and metal. ATMs are touched by hundreds of human hands a day. And there have been studies that show smartphones are heavily contaminated with bacteria because of their constant use.

Even the Federal Reserve has taken efforts to make sure the money supply is not contaminated. Banknotes that circulated in Europe and Asia are being quarantined for seven to 10 days as a “precautionary measure,” according to a Federal Reserve spokesperson.

While businesses are discouraging cash usage, there have been reports of customers making large withdrawals from ATMs in several parts of the country. Some banks have had to order additional cash from the Fed or keep ATMs stocked at higher levels to allow larger customer withdrawals.

Banknote avoidance is not just happening in the U.S. In South Korea, which has been more successful in stemming the outbreak, the country’s central bank took all banknotes out of circulation for two weeks or, in some cases, burned paper money.

Iran is suffering the worst outbreak of the virus in the Middle East. Using cash there is common, but in recent weeks many people have avoided it and banks have announced that they will not accept cash from customers. Iranians often have multiple debit cards but cash is widely used in small-scale transactions, like buying bread in bakeries or leaving a tip. Many people have started even being careful in how they hand over debit cards, as contactless payment methods haven’t caught on there.",https://www.staradvertiser.com/2020/03/19/breaking-news/paper-money-being-shunned-for-fear-of-coronavirus-spread/,,,"['Arts & Entertainment', 'Volcano Coverage', 'Columnists', 'Politics', 'Red Hill Water Crisis', 'America in Turmoil', 'Recipes', 'Crime', 'Russia Attacks Ukraine', 'Coronavirus Resources']"
7205,1556357391,['Scott Powers'],Priorities USA ads pound Donald Trump on coronavirus response,en,,,,"TV commercials, digital ads hit Trump, promote Joe Biden.","Priorities USA is launching a series of digital and television campaign advertising Tuesday that slams President Donald Trump for his response on the COVID-19 crisis, stringing together dismissive quotes from the President’s early statements.

“No, I don’t take responsibility at all,” the video clip shows Trump stating as a fever line tracking American cases soars upward from teens to tens of thousands, heading upward from there on a skyrocketing curve.

“America needs a leader we can trust,” text on the screen declares at the conclusion of the 30-second television commercial, “Exponential Threat.”

That’s one of two TV ads the Democratic-allied committee is releasing through social media Monday in Florida and fellow swing states Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin and is part of a $6 million TV and digital buy. Priorities USA said it’s considering expanding the campaign to other states as well.

The second TV ad, “Better Prepared,” gives a glowing feel to expectations that Democratic rival former Vice President Joe Biden would provide leadership America could trust.

Trump victory spokeswoman Emma Vaughn replied by saying that while Trump is saving American lives Democrats are playing politics.

“President Trump has taken bold and decisive action that has undoubtedly saved American lives while Democrats in D.C. are playing political games holding up legislation that would help millions during these trying times. Democrats should put politics aside and come together for the sake of our country,” Vaughn stated in a news release.

Additionally, Priorities USA is releasing two digital ads that will begin running on Tuesday across a variety of online platforms like Facebook and streaming TV.

These ads — “Map” and “Steady Leadership” — feature similar themes as their longer TV counterparts, contending that Trump refused to adequately prepare the country for the coming crisis and that Biden would provide a significant departure from the chaos.

Since last week, Priorities has also been promoting news content to voters in critical battleground states painting Trump’s coronavirus efforts as a failure to respond effectively to the mounting crisis.

“From the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak, Donald Trump has repeatedly misled the American people and exposed us to unnecessary danger. His failure to lead continues to have real life and death consequences as hospitals, local and state governments, small businesses, and millions of Americans are left without the tools and information they need,” Priorities USA Chairman Guy Cecil wrote in a news release. “Tens of thousands of people are sick, hundreds have already died, and millions are losing their jobs. We simply cannot allow Donald Trump to continue to lie and spread misinformation unchecked. The American people deserve the truth about their president.”",https://floridapolitics.com/archives/324754-priorities-usa-ads-pound-donald-trump-on-coronavirus-response,,,"['campaign', 'Donald Trump', 'Digital ads', 'response', 'COVID-19', 'new coronavirus', 'president', 'Priorities USA', 'crisis', 'democrats', 'TV commercials', 'Joe Biden', '2020 election']"
7234,1615633091,['Liza Gordon'],Jueza pide al ICE explicar mejor por qué no libera a menores,en,,,,,"Una jueza federal censuró el viernes la manera en la que el gobierno del presidente Donald Trump ha manejado la detención de niños y familias inmigrantes, ordenándole que entregue a la corte información detallada sobre sus planes para liberarlos con prontitud debido al coronavirus.

La jueza federal Dolly M. Gee le ordenó al gobierno que mejore su explicación de por qué no ha puesto en libertad a algunos de los aproximadamente 350 padres y menores en tres centros de detención de familias.

El Servicio de Control de Inmigración y Aduanas (ICE, por sus siglas en inglés) ha sido blanco de fuertes críticas por presuntamente haberles preguntado a los padres detenidos si permitirían que sus hijos fueran dejados en libertad sin ellos.

A los padres que se encuentran en las tres instalaciones —una en Pensilvania y dos en Texas— se les preguntó durante reuniones breves si había patrocinadores disponibles que cuidaran de sus hijos, dijeron la semana pasada abogados que representan a las familias. Después les solicitaron que firmaran un formulario.

El ICE ha declinado darlo a conocer.

Gee escribió que no halló que el ICE buscara oficialmente conseguir esas dispensas formales, sino que las conversaciones de los agentes con los padres detenidos “causaron confusión y agitación emocional innecesaria, y no parecían servir al propósito legítimo de la agencia de hacer consultas individualizadas continuas relacionadas con las acciones para dejar en libertad a los menores”.

Aunque algunos padres informaron de detalles ligeramente distintos, los abogados señalaron que en general los progenitores creyeron que se les estaba preguntando elegir entre quedarse detenidos con sus hijos o dejar que los menores se fueran.

“Les pedían a las madres separarse de sus hijos de 1 año para ir con un patrocinador que tal vez nunca se ha reunido o conocido al niño”, dijo Bridget Cambria, directora ejecutiva del grupo ALDEA, que representa a las familias en el centro de detención del ICE en Leesport, Pensilvania.

El gobierno de Trump volvió a enfrentar acusaciones de que está intentando separar a las familias inmigrantes dentro de sus medidas para reforzar la seguridad en la frontera. La separación de familias inmigrantes fue censurada por ambos partidos en 2018 cuando el gobierno de Trump puso en marcha una política de “cero tolerancia” a los cruces en la frontera sur.

El Servicio de Control de Inmigración y Aduanas acusó a los defensores de los inmigrantes de hacer “tergiversaciones”, y dijo que continúa acatando la orden ejecutiva de 2018 de Trump de poner fin a la separación de familias. En un comunicado, la agencia dijo el jueves que el formulario fue utilizado como parte de una “revisión de rutina a la libertad condicional acorde con la ley” y con las órdenes previas de Gee.

“La corte reconoció que los padres, no el gobierno, deben decidir si los chicos deben ser entregados a un patrocinador”, señaló la agencia. “Para cumplir con esta orden, se requería que el ICE verificara a cada uno de los menores —y sus padres— en custodia… para hacer determinaciones individuales de libertad provisional respecto de esos menores”.

En documentos presentados el 15 de mayo ante la corte, el gobierno subrayó mas de 170 veces que se había rehusado a dejar en libertad a los niños que continúan detenidos porque el “padre no quiere la separación”. Sin dar detalles, el gobierno consideró que muchos menores podrían darse a la fuga.

Gee pidió el viernes al gobierno y activistas diseñar un nuevo proceso para determinar si las familias pueden ser puestas en libertad.

La jueza supervisa un acuerdo de la corte conocido como el acuerdo Flores, el cual controla cómo se supone que Estados Unidos debe tratar a los niños migrantes en su custodia.

Durante la pandemia de coronavirus, el gobierno de Estados Unidos ha prohibido el ingreso de familias y niños que desean obtener asilo. Ha expulsado a centenares de niños a los pocos días de que cruzaron la frontera desde México en lugar de entregarlos a instalaciones del gobierno diseñadas para cuidarlos, algo que establece la ley federal.

La agencia afirma que deja en libertad a la mayoría de las familias de sus centros de detención antes de 20 días, el límite general previsto en el acuerdo Flores respecto de la detención de un menor en una instalación segura.

Sin embargo, muchas familias actualmente en custodia continúan detenidas durante meses, algunas desde el año pasado.

Los activistas sostienen que el ICE debería dejar en libertad a todas las familias, en especial debido a la veloz propagación del coronavirus en los centros de detención de inmigrantes, donde más de 1.100 personas se han contagiado y alrededor del 50% de las pruebas han dado positivo. En el mayor centro de detención de familias del ICE en Dilley, Texas, los detenidos incluyen a un niño con epilepsia, un bebé de 1 año con problemas respiratorios, y varios niños con soplos cardíacos, según Shalyn Fluharty, directora del grupo jurídico Proyecto Dilley.

El ICE afirma que ha dejado en libertad a centenares de personas a las que consideraba muy expuestas al virus, aunque ha impugnado demandas en todo el país en las que se exige la liberación de otras.

El gobierno de Trump también está apelando la orden de Gee del año pasado que le impide poner fin al acuerdo Flores.",https://web.archive.org/web/20200602203414id_/http://www.noticiasrhodeisland.com/jueza-pide-al-ice-explicar-mejor-por-que-no-libera-a-menores/,,,

The start of 2020 is going to be with night sky lighting up with Quadrantid meteor shower on January 3 and 4. Stargazers in the UAE can expect to witness the spectacular starting Friday until predawn hours on Saturday when the meteor shower will be at peak.

According to International Meteor Organization (IMO), the Quadrantids can shower around 50 to 100 meteors in an hour but have a narrow peak window compared to other meteor showers.

However, the Quadrantids are considered to be one of the best because they are fireball meteors that come from larger particles of matter. Fireball meteors are much brighter, and their light and color lasts longer than your average meteor shower, according to Inverse.com.

The IMO predicts that the shower's peak will occur around 3am EST on January 4, and only last for about four hours.

According to Dubai Astronomy Group, the best time to see it is before dawn, starting at 2 after midnight on the northeastern side. The group will be hosting a event at Al Qudra Lake from 10pm-3am.

The Quadrantids will take place in the northern part of the sky and hence it will visible better from the Northern Hemisphere.",https://www.khaleejtimes.com/news/general/meteor-shower-visible-in-uae-skies-on-this-weekend,,,

It’s vacation rentals.

Indeed, go ask that question among St. Armands Key residents, on Longboat Key and especially on Anna Maria Island.

It’s a national issue. Everywhere, elected leaders are struggling with how vacation rentals should be regulated and who should regulate them.

Should Airbnb homes be required to meet all of the safety and licensing standards and regulations as hotels? Who should have jurisdiction, local governments or the state government?

Once again in Tallahassee, the issue is on lawmakers’ agendas.

Senate Bill 1128 and House Bill 1011 are proposing what former state Sen. Greg Steube of Sarasota (now Congressman Steube) tried for two years. That is have the state preempt local governments and rule all vacation rentals.

This is a conundrum, to be sure. Government is best closest to the people. Citizens incorporate precisely to have control over their communities, not be ruled by the far-away state.

But at the same time, you can make an argument that NIMBYism is so pervasive that vocal neighbors want their cities to ban vacation rentals altogether. In the process, they are forgetting all about property rights. Why should you be allowed to have 10 relatives stay with you but your neighbor be prohibited from renting his home to 10 of his old college friends?

SB 1128 and HB 1011 are indeed flawed — mostly on the regulations they would create for those advertising vacation rentals. Both bills should be tabled.

The group said that its member-schools will cease to exist if September opening shall be mandated, noting that if that happens, the problem of private schools may not be the lack of students but lack of teachers.

“It has to be understood that our teachers are hardly included in any amelioration projects of the government,” said FAPSA president Eleazardo Kasilag.

This comes after The IATF-MEID on Friday said that the opening of classes for the next school year should be scheduled in September, except for online learning.

Presidential spokesperson Harry Roque, however, said that higher education institutions in areas under general community quarantine may continue classes to finish the academic year.

The group has asked the Department of Education to help private schools to coordinate with IATF-EID to include teachers from private schools in small business wage subsidy.

“We were left out in COVID-19 Adjustment Measures Program, the DSWD (Department of Social Welfare and Development) Emergency Subsidy Program and Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program. This is indeed an oasis in the barren desert,” Kasilag said. “The teachers of our small and medium size member schools are crying for their survival right now.”

Kasilag stressed that private schools are not business entities as they are registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission as non-stock, non-profit and they survive on tuition fees.

“We have big collectibles that we missed to get because classes are stopped in March,” Kasilag said. “FAPSA schools did not hold final exams and we did not hold graduation exercises. These two major events in schools are the culmination of school year 2019-2020 but they did not take place and they are also incentives for the indebted parents to pay arrearages.”

He stressed that from March to September are just seven long months when private school teachers will not receive anything.

“From what we understand, the people involved all know each other,” Faessel said. “There wasn’t some unknown person who showed up.”

While the suspect was known to the people at the funeral, police haven’t identified him or released a description. It’s not clear whether witnesses to the shooting have helped in the investigation.

“This isn’t completely out of the ordinary,” Faessel said of the shooting.

He noted detectives were looking into the possibility of an inter-family conflict that led to the violence.

“You can imagine a scenario were there’s family issues at play, or you can image a scenario where people who may want to pay their respects to the deceased family member aren’t necessarily there to pay their respect to other family members,” he said.

Police were still looking for the suspect. They asked anyone with information about the shooting to call the Cypress Police Department Criminal Investigation Bureau at (714) 229-6631, or Orange County Crime Stoppers at 1-855-TIP-OCCS.",https://www.ocregister.com/2020/05/24/cypress-police-still-searching-for-gunman-who-shot-another-man-after-forest-lawn-burial/,,,"['Crime', 'Top Stories OCR', 'shooting']"

全国人大常委会周四（18日）在北京召开会议，鉴于会上可能审议「港版国安法」，全球86个人权组织，向人大委员长栗战书发公开信，要求北京停止在香港实施国安法。另外，香港政制及内地事务局局长曾国衞表示，若立法会选举参选人反对「港版国安法」，或会被取消参选资格，有立法会议员批评政府制造白色恐怖。（黄乐涛 报道）

86个国际及香港的人权组织，向栗战书发公开信，内容指「港版国安法」的立法细节尚未清楚，人大提到的罪行包括「颠覆」、「恐怖主义」、「分裂」及「外部势力干预」的定义含糊不清，罪行可以包含任何批评政府的言论，以及用以打压捍卫人权的人士。

公开信又指，中国法律「国家安全」概念的范围广阔且涉及模糊的覆盖面，导致很多人权律师、学者及网民等，被当局以「颠覆」、「分裂国家」和「泄露国家机密」等罪判刑。

从过往在中国实行国家安全法的经验显示，不论法例条文本身及其应用，均不符合国际人权法律和标准，若果中央在香港设立国安机构，即意味着国家安全部或公安部国内安全保卫局等单位在香港运作，打压香港的人权自由。

有份联署的香港中国维权律师关注组，组识总干事陈悦周三（17日）对本台表示，北京当局欲以含糊不清的「港版国安法」去打压民主人士，认为这封联署信对北京当局有警惕的作用。

陈悦说︰（「港被国安法」）内很多的执行措施与力度，以及如何去处理这些案件，其实我们是不知道，执法机关在哪里，我们亦不知道，我们很担忧究竟这条法例会否将来成为打压异见人士及人权组织或维权人士的一套法律，只要有足够的国际压力，以及有一个民间团体的力量，我觉得仍然是会对于中共下这个决定，其实都会有影响。

另外，香港立法会选举9月举行，政制及内地事务局局长曾国衞表示，如果参选人反对「港版国安法」，会惹人质疑是否效忠特区，会由选举主任决定候选人会否不符合参选资格。

曾国衞说︰从原则上，反对这件事的话，是否等于你，所谓如果我们要符合候选人的要求，效忠中华人民共和国香港特别行政区，我只是指这件事会惹人质疑。至于具体是否真的宣布有效，在候选人的资格，这个始终都是相关的选举主任，去因应实际情况有需要时，征询法律意见的情况下来决定，不是我说了就算。

公民党立法会议员谭文豪批评政府制造白色恐怖，打压民主派议员。

谭文豪说︰搞这个国安法，除了恐吓香港人，亦都是将这件事，以及将政治捆绑、选举捆绑，所以其实上可以看到根本上由始至终，他们（政府）都是想利用这条国安法，去制造一个白色恐怖，亦都是以作打压民主派，无论是参选又好，或者是继续从政都好，其实整件事是很明确的。

全国人大常委谭耀宗出席一个电台节目时表示，周四全国人大常委会会议，暂未知会否审议「港版国安法」。他认为，若「港版国安法」订立后，例如涉及有外国势力干预香港事务的严重案件，这明显要由中央处理。他说，触犯该条例的港人，若中央认为有关人士有必要移交大陆受审，亦是一个选项，要视乎中央如何行使管辖权。",https://web.archive.org/web/20201205211722id_/https://www.rfa.org/cantonese/news/htm/hk-security-06172020075017.html?encoding=simplified,,,

全国人大常委会周四（18日）开会正式审议「港版国安法」，并将之前「外国和境外势力干预香港特别行政区事务」罪名改成「勾结外国或者境外势力危害国家安全」，律政司长郑若骅被问到「勾结」的具体含意以及香港法律是否存有「勾结」时竟不懂回答，推说「都系头先睇到呢个新闻」，要视乎人大常委怎样写，有详细资料才可评论。根据《基本法》第十八条，但凡是全国性法律纳入香港，必先谘询特区政府官员研究如何执行，郑若骅坦白说自己也被蒙在鼓里，等于证明人大常委正在违宪了！

所谓「外国和境外势力干预香港特别行政区事务」罪名改成「勾结外国或者境外势力危害国家安全」，究竟意义何在？ 保安局长李家超似乎心里比郑若骅清楚，他日前接受港台访问时就明言，如果港人请外国制裁香港，就不算一般交流，相信日后「港版国安法」会有条文，将讲明哪些行为不能容许云云。若然拥有美国国藉的香港居民日后到白宫游说，这是否算是「勾结外国势力」呢？ 「港版国安法」能把民主运动的国际战线断根吗？

港澳办副主任邓中华周一（15日）说，立法既要与内地《国安法》、《反恐法》等全国性法律衔接，也会在法律概念、用词用语和立法方式等方面兼顾香港社会的认受性。如果中共希望「港版国安法」兼顾到「香港社会的认受性」，为何立法就是不能用普通法条文编写呢？

邓中华又声称特区政府有「主要责任」维护国家安全，执法和司法等应由特区完成，但在「极其特殊的情况下中央亦要保留对案件的管辖权力」，香港大律师公会主席戴启思日前接受港台访问时认为，上述说法反映中央试图掌控香港最严重的国家安全案件，做法犹如「送中」恶法的「逆向工程」。戴启思又批评，至今仍未清楚内地政府建议的「港版国安法」具体内容，但目前看来，该法似乎是普通法和大陆法的「奇怪混合体」（weird hybrid）。

全国人大常委谭耀宗称，不应排除中央有权把违反「港版国安法」人士移交内地审理。但全国政协常委唐英年却认为，现行《逃犯条例》不容许移交疑犯到内地，「港版国安法」不应抵触《基本法》，中央草拟法案时须考虑如何适应本港现行法律。唐英年又强调，根据现行《逃犯条例》，港府不容许把犯人移交内地、澳门及台湾。唐英年这「反送中」杂音，中共会考虑听取吗？

香港记者协会日前公布调查发现，98%新闻从业员反对订立「港版国安法」，有87%人认为会影响新闻自由；有53%十分担心日后人身安全受威胁；有63%对新闻自由前景十分悲观。香港传媒理应除了《苹果日报》之外，十之八九都全面归顺了，为何反对立法的记者是如此的一面倒？特首林郑月娥说，「300 万」港人签名撑《国安法》，反对者都是与广大市民为敌，那么是否代表所有记者都与民为敌呢？

政制及内地事务局局长曾国衞周三（17日）指，如参选人从根本上、原则上反对《国安法》，会令人质疑他们是否符合「效忠香港特区」的角逐议席要求。民主派应如何应对？应否一起捆绑立场一起反对？还是用尽一切方法，先做好协调选到立会过半？坚持反对《国安法》立场又如何与规DQ（取消资格）作好平衡？

7550,1543735896,['Online News Editor'],Un billete de ida para huir de la crisis del Líbano,en,,,,,"LÍBANO CRISIS

Beirut, 10 mar (EFE).- Cuando las protestas estallaron el 17 de octubre en El Líbano, Youmma Hamooud se fue a la calle ilusionada y entusiasmada; cinco meses después ha perdido la esperanza y solo busca un billete de ida para huir de un país que se va hundiendo en una de las peores crisis económicas de su historia.

“Nuestra generación perdió la última batalla”, asegura a Efe Hammoud, de 22 años, que no puede ocultar cómo “las grandes esperanzas” que tenía puestas en el futuro de su país cuando miles de personas salieron a las calles para exigir un cambio en el régimen político del país han desaparecido.

“Pensé que no quería irme, pero ahora me veo obligada a encontrar un futuro mejor”, añadió esta joven graduada en Gestión de Conservación de Recursos Naturales en Beirut.

El caso de Hammoud no es el único. Según datos de la consultora regional Information International en 2019 las salidas con carácter definitivo de libaneses se duplicaron en 2019 con relación a 2018.

UN PAÍS QUE SE HUNDE EN LA CRISIS

El primer ministro libanés, Hasan Diab, admitió el pasado día 7 que el Líbano se está “hundiendo” en la peor crisis desde que terminó la guerra civil, en 1990, que asoló el país.

El pasado 17 de octubre, los libaneses tomaron las calles hastiados de la corrupción de la clase dirigente y de una situación que le ha llevado a ser uno de los más endeudados del mundo.

El Líbano arrastra una deuda pública, según afirmó Diab, que supera los 90.000 millones de dólares, lo que supone un 170 % del PIB.

El Gobierno anunció el fin de semana que, por primera vez en su historia, entraba en cese de pagos de deuda externa al no poder honrar un vencimiento en eurobonos de 1.200 millones de dólares el 9 de marzo.

Diab reveló, en un duro discurso a la nación, que un 40 por ciento de la población “pronto se verá bajo el umbral de la pobreza” y el país necesita ese dinero para cubrir las necesidades básicas de sus ciudadanos.

LA HUIDA

Según cifras de la consultora Information International ofrecidas a Efe, el número de libaneses que emigraron en los últimos tres meses de 2019 cuando comenzaron las protestas alcanzó los 19.263 libaneses respecto a los 14.129 libaneses del mismo periodo en 2018.

Además, la firma apunta que en todo 2019 fueron 66.806 libaneses los que compraron un billete de ida para no regresar, respecto a los 33.841 del año anterior, lo que representa un aumento del 97,5 % en un país de 6 millones de habitantes.

Guita G. Hourani, directora del Centro de Investigación Libanés para Estudios de Migración y Diáspora subraya a Efe que para “la migración a largo plazo, la mayoría de los libaneses están eligiendo Estados Unidos, Canadá, Francia, Suecia, Alemania, Armenia y Australia, entre otros”.

Aunque aquellos que buscan trabajo “optan ahora por las oportunidades que se ofrece en Asia y Europa del Este, que se consideran nuevos destinos para la migración libanesa “.

EL COSTO DE UNA NUEVA VIDA

Araz Topalian asegura a Efe que está haciendo lo posible para irse, pero salir tampoco es sencillo.

“Hablé con un abogado de inmigración para ir a Canadá y me pidió 7.000 dólares solo por sus honorarios. (…) Es demasiado caro por lo que he decidido hacer yo solo el proceso”, explica este joven con un postgrado en Arquitectura.

“Si alguna vez me voy, nunca volveré y no culpo al gobierno, culpo a toda la nación”, afirma.

7565,1562187196,,"10 quarantined Filipinos test negative for coronavirus, 4 await lab results",en,,,,This is contrary to Health Secretary Francisco Duque III's earlier statement that all 13 symptomatic repatriates have tested negative for the highly-infectious illness.,"Metro Manila (CNN Philippines, March 2) — Ten Filipinos quarantined at the New Clark City have been cleared for coronavirus infection while four others are awaiting their test results from the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM), a health official said Monday.

Health Assistant Maria Rosario Vergeire said 14 Filipinos from the Diamond Princess cruise ship showed flu-like symptoms, such as fever, cough, and sore throat that could indicate COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.

""Among the 14 PUIs (patients under investigation), 10 tested negative for COVID-19 while 4 are with pending laboratory results. The PUIs are still admitted at the referral facility,"" Health Assistant Maria Rosario Vergeire said in a media briefing.

This is contrary to Health Secretary Francisco Duque III's earlier statement that all 13 symptomatic repatriates have tested negative for the highly-infectious illness.

Eight of the 10 who tested negative are set to be sent back to the New Clark City Athlete's Village to complete their quarantine after recovering from their mild illnesses.

All in all, 445 Filipinos — mostly crew members — were brought home from the Diamond Princess cruise ship last week. The repatriates, along with the health and foreign affairs personnel and volunteers from the Philippine Embassy in Tokyo who helped bring them home, were transported to the sporting village in Tarlac for the second round of 14-day quarantine.

Overseas Workers Welfare Administration Administrator Hans Cacdac said the Filipino crew will be given P10,000 each and transportation allowance to travel from New Clark City to their homes in the Philippines once they complete the quarantine requirements.

The repatriation did not include 80 Filipinos who have fallen ill to COVID-19 in Japan. Of this number, 32 have already recovered. Ten of those have already returned to the Philippines, while 22 other await repatriation details and will undergo strict DOH monitoring.

Some Americans, Britons, and Australians who were previously on the Diamond Princess only tested positive for coronavirus after they returned home from a 14-day quarantine. Among them is a 78-year-old man from Perth, Australia who became that country's first reported death due to the virus.

The World Health Organization said the most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea, while others become infected but don’t develop any symptoms. About 80 percent of those infected recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who get COVID-19 become seriously ill and develop difficulty breathing. Older people and those with underlying medical problmes like high blood pressure or diabetes are more likely to develop serious illness, the WHO added.

There are 43 patients under investigation admitted in various hospitals. The Philippines has three confirmed COVID-19 cases. Two of them have already recovered and returned to China, while one died — the first recorded death outside of mainland China.",https://cnnphilippines.com/news/2020/3/2/Coronavirus-Philippines-Diamond-Princesss-quarantine.html?fbclid=IwAR1bOZ2A65lCDONsNXDcjqtF8vX7W1jYUkLIdosSizksjOvNgb43u4U2hVI,,,

An open database exposing records containing the sensitive data of hotel customers as well as US military personnel and officials has been disclosed by researchers.

On Monday, vpnMentor's cybersecurity team, led by Noam Rotem and Ran Locar, said the database belonged to Autoclerk, a service owned by Best Western Hotels and Resorts group.

Autoclerk is a reservations management system used by resorts to manage web bookings, revenue, loyalty programs, guest profiles, and payment processing.

In a report shared with ZDNet, the researchers said the open Elasticsearch database was discovered through vpnMentor's web mapping project. It was possible to access the database, given it had no encryption or security barriers whatsoever, and perform searches to examine the records contained within.

The team says that ""thousands"" of individuals were impacted, although due to ethical reasons it was not possible to examine every record in the leaking database to come up with a specific number.

Hundreds of thousands of booking reservations for guests were available to view and data including full names, dates of birth, home addresses, phone numbers, dates and travel costs, some check-in times and room numbers, and masked credit card details were also exposed.

Data breaches are a common occurrence and can end up compromising information belonging to thousands or millions of us in single cases of a successful cyberattack.

What is more uncommon, however, is that the US government and military figures have also been involved in this security incident.

It appears that one of the platforms connected to Autoclerk exposed in the breach is a contractor of the US government that deals with travel arrangements.

vpnMentor was able to view records relating to the travel arrangements of government and military personnel -- both past and future -- who are connected to the US government, military, and Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

Within the records, for example, were logs for US Army generals visiting Russia and Israel, among other countries.

Autoclerk facilitates communication between different hospitality platforms, and it appears that a substantial portion of the data originated from external platforms. In total, the database -- hosted by AWS -- contained over 179GB of data.

At the time of writing it has not been possible to track the overall owner of the database due to the ""number of external origin points and sheer size of the data exposed,"" the team says.

The United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (CERT) was informed of the leak on September 13 but did not respond to the researcher's findings.

vpnMentor then reached out to the US Embassy in Tel Aviv, and seven days later, the team contacted a representative of the Pentagon who promised swift action. Access to the database was revoked on October 2.

TechRepublic: Financial industry spends millions to deal with breaches

""The greatest risk posed by this leak is to the US government and military,"" the team says. ""Significant amounts of sensitive employee and military personnel data could now be in the public domain. This gives invaluable insight into the operations and activities of the US government and military personnel. The national security implications for the US government and military are wide-ranging and serious.""

ZDNet has reached out to US-CERT and affected parties and will update when we hear back.

李心洁直认自己与《夕雾花园》片中女主角“云林”的相似之处是她们都有坚强的特质，也一样看重感情，她透露朋友看了电影后对她说，“你就很云林啊！”

她直言从“云林”身上发现与现实中自己相似的特质，“我们都很坚强，拥有很强大很坚定的意志，也一样是很重感情的人，只要一陷入就会百分百的投入，当失去一段感情时就会很难过，所以当我读剧本的时候，我很能了解云林失去爱人的痛苦。”

改编自马来西亚作家陈团英同名小说的《夕雾花园》，即将于1月16日全马隆重上映，导演林书宇周四联同主要演员李心洁、张艾嘉、林宣妤及来自槟城的原著小说作家陈团英出席记者会分享电影的拍摄点滴。

原著作者陈团英认为，导演很成功地把他的文字转换成画面，拍成一部电影，他感叹道：“拍摄出来的每一幕都像是一幅画，我从来没有看过金马仑那么漂亮的模样。”

林书宇日前接受大马媒体访问时透露，碍于大马电影尺度，他特地为大马剪辑了一个“干净版”，他表示，片中李心洁和日本演员阿部宽的浴缸激情戏缩短了一半，但他加入了一段前戏，增加了更多情绪戏和让人感触的画面，以确保电影的完整性。

张艾嘉、李心洁在片中首度挑战同一角色的不同年龄，饰演年老版云林的张艾嘉笑言希望自己能够年轻30多岁，“这样我就可以演年轻版的云林了”，引来全场大笑。

被问及拍摄大马电影的感受时，张艾嘉指“电影就是电影，不分语言、国家，电影是国际化的，只有好电影之分。”

李心洁表示，战俘营的部分是最后才拍摄，称那个时候的自己早就已经和“云林”融为一体，还透露朋友看了她在戏中被日本军鞭打戏后，都心疼得哭了。

而戏中饰演李心洁妹妹的林宣妤则表示，这是她第2部参与的电影，很荣幸可以和李心洁合作，她说之前并没有演过这么沉重的角色，所以这个角色对她来说非常有挑战性，而为了解当年的战俘和慰安妇，她在拍摄前也看了不少纪录片做功课。

【首映礼】

为电影创作演唱主题曲

郭修彧1天就交货

为电影《夕雾花园》创作并演唱主题曲《Exist》的本地创作歌手郭修彧，一天时间内就完成作品“交货”，高效率及高水准的作品让导演林书宇赞赏有加。

改编自同名电影的《夕雾花园》，导演林书宇与演员李心洁、张艾嘉等马不停蹄的在马展开宣传工作行程，周四晚举行首映礼，活动现场郭修彧的歌声为首映礼掀开了序幕，嘹亮及具渲染力的歌声触动全场。

她及后与导演在后台接受媒体的访问时提及此次的合作经过，“当听了导演叙述电影的故事后，我用了一天的时间完成创作，其实要为这么棒的电影创作主题曲的压力真的很大。”

郭修彧说，最担心的是怕自己写不出像电影这么大气有气势的歌曲，达不到导演的要求。而作品出来后，她放下心头大石，毕竟编曲部分为歌曲加了很高的分数。

对于当初林书宇为什么在芸芸歌手中选择郭修彧，导演说，一开始的确为《夕雾花园》需不需要一首主题曲而挣扎，经过连番考量最终觉得需要为电影做个总结。

在考虑人选方面，因为电影与马来西亚脱不了关系，因此人选就设定在大马歌手的范围。

“考虑人选之际，耳边一直出现郭修彧的名字，加上我认识Penny姐（戴佩妮），她也有一直推荐修彧，于是促成了这次的合作。”

林导演说，让他惊讶的是郭修彧一次过交了两首作品供他选择，而《Exist》的旋律是他一听就喜欢的，只在词意方面有稍微修饰一下。",https://web.archive.org/web/20200111145331id_/https://eunited.com.my/336215/,,,
7626,1531413897,,The 12 Year Wait to End “The Clone Wars”,en,,,,,"On Friday, Feb. 21 at 12 a.m. PST, Disney+ dropped the season seven premiere of Dave Filoni’s epic animated series “Star Wars: The Clone Wars,” which premiered over a decade ago in 2008. The season is Disney’s latest success with the rights of “Star Wars,” after season one of its series “The Mandalorian” became the most-streamed show in the world. However, where “The Mandalorian” thrives due to creating new, original characters, “The Clone Wars” must rely on the main characters of the prequel trilogy to tell its story. The critical reception to the episode and rallying of fan support proves that Filoni mastered the art of building on existing characterization.

During its original run from 2008 to 2014 on Cartoon Network, “The Clone Wars” was one of the most highly-rated shows ever on the network, received widespread acclaim for improving the characters of the franchise, and won multiple Daytime Emmy awards. While originally marketed as a children’s series, the seasons became darker as the audience aged, delving into the repercussions of war and the balance of good and evil in the Force. However, in 2013 the show was effectively canceled, and the remaining episodes that would tie up the war were scrapped. It was not until the acquisition of the series by Disney, with the creation of its streaming service, that a final season of 12 episodes to officially end the series was announced.

“Star Wars: The Clone Wars” takes place inside the “Star Wars” prequel trilogy, which tells the story of Anakin Skywalker’s downfall from a Jedi Knight to Darth Vader after serving in a three-year war known as the Clone Wars. The Clone Wars take place before “Episode III: Revenge of the Sith,” during a period when both Skywalker and his master Obi-Wan Kenobi are generals in the war, and Skywalker is secretly married to Luke and Leia’s future-mother Padmé Amidala. When the series premiered in 2008 after a theatrical film release served as its pilot, supervising director Filoni juggled the narrative themes of Skywalker’s future fall and the villainy of Palpatine while also taking on the challenge of doing the impossible: making the Clone Wars interesting.

The war is fought between a robot droid army called Separatists and an army of cloned men created by the Republic to be expendable soldiers with an enhanced aging process to ensure the maximum number of bodies. In every battle fought in this literal ‘star war’ droids and clones become blaster-fodder on alien planets while the Jedi are essentially a metaphor for the United Nations: attempting to create peace but with no ability to enforce it. The prequels were heavily criticized for the soulless nature of the war and the lack of stakes involved, as well as the ineffective portrayal of Anakin Skywalker and Padmé Amidala.

By contrast, in each 22-minute animated episode of “The Clone Wars,” Filoni took the time to flesh out these characters and explore the depth of the narrative themes at stake. In order to effectively portray Anakin’s growth into a Jedi master that takes place off-screen in “Revenge of the Sith,” Filoni created the character of Ahsoka Tano, a young female Jedi who becomes Anakin’s apprentice. Although initially seen as bratty, Ahsoka’s bravery, skill, and determination to do the right thing in wartime ultimately made her one of the most popular characters in “Star Wars” and a feminist figure.

Ahsoka Tano also serves as an excellent sounding board for Anakin and the viewer as she questioned her master about the nature of the Jedi Council that requires them to be both soldiers and peace-keepers. In several episodes, Ahsoka questions these contradictions while Anakin is struggling to reconcile his marriage with his duty. By its very nature, the series has to balance foreshadowing what’s to come, but by choosing to focus on this reality Filoni ultimately paved the way for Luke Skywalker’s arc in “The Last Jedi,” where he states: “At the height of [the Jedi’s] powers, they allowed Darth Sidious to rise, create the empire, and wipe them out.”

All main characters in the original series get arcs to develop their characters, but further fleshed out than any other characters, however, are the clones.

The clone characters name-dropped in the saga (Cody, Rex, Fives, and Echo to name a few) are soldiers desperate to do their duty with a sense of individuality, formulating a culture of brotherhood among one another and using what little tools they have– hairstyles, tattoos, and body armor– to distinguish themselves from the masses. At first, the clones are passionate about the war they were created for. However, the longer all the dying stretches out the more disillusioned everyone becomes.

The season seven premiere, 12 years after the first season began, returns to this formula by focusing on the clones and Anakin Skywalker. The episode, titled “The Bad Batch,” features the clones on a mission with several noticeably mutated clones whose glaring uniqueness serves as their strength, and Anakin watches as Rex lets his emotions fuel his mission– the same thing Anakin is constantly criticized for by his superiors throughout the series. By jumping back into the thematic plots that are its greatest strength, the premiere received widespread acclaim and the series was called “better than ever” by USA Today.

The series does not pause to remind viewers of the events and characters they watched during the six-year break, instead of trusting (rightfully) that its fanbase will remember. Where so many other entries in the “Star Wars” franchise lead to frustration and discourse (i.e. the sequel trilogy), “The Clone Wars” has found a method that appeases “Star Wars” fans and actually builds on what people love about this fictional story. The series also proves that fans are willing to wait indefinitely to have closure.

Season seven of “Star Wars:The Clone Wars” is released weekly on Disney+. Episode 2 will air on Friday, Feb. 28 at 12am PST.

That is exactly what Israel’s Benjamin Netanyahu declared when claiming he had won the recent Israeli elections when he said that he won among the”Zionist” voters because “Arabs are not part of the equation.” Let that sink in. The reason Palestinian citizens of Israel are a minority is only because during its creation, 750,000 Palestinians were ethnically cleansed from their homeland through Zionist terror.

By ‘Zionist’ Netanyahu refers to Jews, an equivalence we are told should not be made because it is used by some to hide their anti-Jewish sentiments. At a stroke, Netanyahu delegitimised the votes of 300,000 of Israel’s own citizens because they are not Jewish and would not vote for him.

Netanyahu has form when it comes to racism against non-Jewish citizens from his country. In an election day video in 2015 he urged his supporters to go out and vote because “the rule of the right is in danger, Arab voters are coming in droves to the ballot boxes,” Netanyahu declared in the video. “Left-wing NGOs are bringing them in buses.”

However, in quite a hypocritical U-turn after winning the election, Netanyahu decided to reach out to the Palestinian citizens of Israel offering a half-hearted apology. He said “I know the things I said several days ago offended some of Israel’s citizens, hurt the Arab citizens,” Netanyahu told invited representatives of the Arab community at the Prime Minister’s Residence in Jerusalem. “This was never my intent. I apologize for this.”

This was rejected by Joint List leader Ayman Odeh who called the apology a duplicitous “flip-flop.” So long as Netanyahu “advances racist legislation… and does not promote real equality” for Israel’s Arabs, said the MK, the prime minister’s apology would not be acceptable or credible.

Both episodes in 2015 and recently show the racism that is at the core of Netanyahu’s and the right-wing coalition ideology. Palestinian citizens of Israel are at best second class citizens. In 2018, Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman on accused the leader of the Joint (Arab) List MK, Ayman Odeh, and his associates of being a “fifth column” and said they should be “outlawed” for their support of a Gaza solidarity protest in Haifa. Lieberman lamented the “systematic failure” of law enforcement to take action against Odeh “and his friends” and called for them to be “outlawed.”

Current Israeli Defence Minister Naftali Bennet has also revelled in his racism against Palestinians, claiming in 2013, “I’ve killed lots of Arabs in my life – and there’s no problem with that.” In 2017 as Education Minister, he told MKs of Palestinian origin to choose to be either ‘normal Israelis’ or ‘terrorists’. Bennett also believes that Palestinians ‘already have their state in Jordan’.

Blue and White (Kahol Lavan) leader Benny Gantz would not contemplate forming a government with the Joint Arab List claiming he is not “afraid to speak to any legitimate political party, but the Joint List will not be part of the government I form.” He said, “my disagreements with its leadership on the national and security issues are deep, difficult and unbridgeable,”. He continued, “I intend to implement President Trump’s peace plan, in coordination with all the elements in the region, and see it as a significant milestone.” Israel “cannot tolerate support for terrorism or avoid condemnation,” Gantz said.

Gantz did not object to the inclusion in Trump’s plan a provision to strip 300,000 Palestinian Israeli citizens of their citizenship in ‘land swaps’, that would see the area known as the ‘Triangle’ become part of the so called Palestinian state, without asking that population for it’s views.

None of the above discrimination and shear racism against Palestinians and Palestinian citizens of Israel should surprise us. Israel has over sixty laws that discriminate against its Palestinian citizens and Palestinians in the Occupied Territories. And most were implemented before Israel’s main political leadership either drafted or supported in the Knesset in 2018 the ‘Nation State Law’ or as I called it Israel’s “Jewish State Apartheid Law” when it was passed. At its core is the premise that only Jews have a right to self-determination in Israel, whatever Israel’s borders are. In Trump’s plan it is clear that Israel ‘security border is the whole of historic Palestine, from the river Jordan to the Mediterranean Sea.

The question of whether Israel is an Apartheid state was settled in the ESCWA report, which was commissioned to assess in an academic manner by eminent academics Richard Falk and Virginia Tilley. They concluded in the peer reviewed report that Israel exercised Apartheid against the Palestinian people as a whole. And before the usual suspects rubbish the report’s status because ESCWA was asked to take it down from its website, let me assure them about its status.

READ: Palestinian boycott movement slams Austrian parliament anti-BDS motion

I asked former Under-Secretary-General Dr Rima Khalaf who resigned rather than take it down, she assured me that it is still an official UN report. Therefore, its conclusions stand. Israel is an Apartheid state, which should be isolated and shunned until its racist regime is dismantled, leading either to two independent, sovereign states, an Israeli and Palestinian state, or a single democratic state for all those it rules over between the river and the sea.

Israel cannot for ever continue to rule over half the people whose lives it controls on a daily basis, without giving them their legitimate rights and claim to be a democracy. Judging by the violent past 72 years since its creation, it will not have peace until it either separates Jews from others or accepts that all human beings are entitled to be treated equally and accept it cannot be Jewish and Democratic.

And here it cannot claim the problem is with the Palestinians who will not lie down and surrender. Neither can its backers in the West.

It is the same Western governments which sided with the oppressive Apartheid regime in South Africa that are siding with and protecting the Apartheid regime in Israel. Instead of sanctioning it for its crimes, the West bolsters trade with Israel and simply condemns its criminal actions as an illegal occupier who is commits war crimes almost on a daily basis at least in terms of its settlement enterprise. And when the Palestinians seek redress through peaceful, legal means and take the settlement file to the International Criminal Court (ICC), Israel’s backers the US, Germany and Canada ask it not do so by claiming it does not have jurisdiction over Palestine because it is not a state.

When the Palestinians call for peaceful Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS), the US and France pass anti-BDS laws and France equates BDS to anti-Semitism. The UK has tried to ban pension funds from divestment from companies complicit in Israel’s crimes and the Conservative Government only had Israel in mind when announcing it would legislate against boycotts by public bodies in its manifesto. It has also committed to forcing public bodies, including universities to adopt the flawed IHRA working definition of anti-Semitism, which has more to do with shielding Israel from criticism than it does protecting British Jews from real anti-Semitism. That is also the reason why Israel’s advocates have tried and failed to cancel Israel Apartheid Week on campuses across the world.

It seems the so-called international community is sending not mixed but rather clear signals to the Palestinians. They stand with Israeli Apartheid and against Palestinian rights. This is hypocrisy on heat.

Researchers looked at brain tissue from 56 people who developed encephalitis between 1999 and 2019. Samples revealed that at least eight people who died of encephalitis were infected with Borna disease virus 1 (BoDV-1), Scientific American reported, citing a study recently published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases.

MYSTERIOUS VIRAL PNEUMONIA OUTBREAK IN CHINA LIKELY CAUSED BY NEW VIRUS, SCIENTISTS SAY

Borna disease (BD), spread by the bicolored white-toothed shrew, is a fatal neurological disease that typically affects horses and sheep and is named after the city in eastern Germany where it first killed hundreds of horses in the 19th century. The findings published in the medical journal “confirm that the virus can infect humans and cause deadly encephalitis,” Scientific American reported.

All eight of those who were infected with BD lived in rural areas and spent a lot of time outdoors. Many of the affected people had been around cats, which are known shrew catchers, as well. Researchers suspect the patients were exposed to the pathogen when the cats presented the dead shrews to their owners. They may have also inhaled dust that contained dried shrew urine (horses and sheep typically are infected after the small mammal urinates in hay.) However, exactly how the virus was transmitted to the patients is not yet known.

As of now, there is no known treatment for the rare virus, which “triggers the host’s immune system to attack brain tissue,” as per Scientific American, and typically causes headache, fever and confusion, which is later followed by “deep coma"" and death. That said, certain antiviral treatments are being considered.

The findings “provide additional material for a better understanding of the disease,” Martin Beer, head of the Institute of Diagnostic Virology at the Friedrich Loeffler Institute in Germany and co-senior author of the study, told the publication. He noted that the risk of infection in humans is “pretty low.”

Moving forward, the researchers urged medical professionals to test for BD in patients with an “unclear cause” of encephalitis.

“BoDV-1 infection has to be considered as a potentially lethal zoonosis in endemic regions with reported spillover infections in horses and sheep. BoDV-1 infection can result in fatal encephalitis in immunocompromised and apparently healthy people. Consequently, all severe encephalitis cases of unclear cause should be tested for bornaviruses especially in endemic regions,” they wrote.",https://www.foxnews.com/health/rare-shrew-spread-virus-german-deaths,,,

Finanzminister Olaf Scholz (SPD) und Wirtschaftsminister Peter Altmaier (CDU) kündigten am Freitag unbegrenzte Kreditprogramme für betroffene Firmen an. Der Bund habe dafür Garantierahmen in Milliardenhöhe angehoben. Der Staat übernimmt damit erheblich mehr Risiko, falls Kredite nicht zurückgezahlt werden. Außerdem geht es um die Stundung von Steuern und Abgaben in Milliardenhöhe. Altmaier und Scholz machten zudem klar: Bei einer weiteren Verschärfung werde der Bund nachlegen.

Ziel eines Maßnahmenpakets ist es, die Liquidität von Firmen sicherzustellen, die wegen der Coronavirus-Krise in Finanznöte geraten - weil Aufträge wegbrechen oder es zu Liefer- und Produktionsengpässen kommt. Es gebe keine Grenze nach oben bei der Kreditsumme, welche die Staatsbank KfW vergeben könne, sagte Scholz. Es sei ausreichend Geld da. Altmaier sprach von der umfassendsten und wirksamsten Hilfestellung, die es in der Geschichte der Bundesrepublik bisher gegeben habe. Es gehe auch darum, das Vertrauen von Investoren in den Standort Deutschland und die EU zu kräftigen.

Die Minister versicherten, die Bundesregierung werde alles Notwendige tun, um die wirtschaftlichen Folgen der Coronaviruskrise einzudämmen. ""Wir legen gleich (...) alle Waffen auf den Tisch und zeigen, dass wir gewissermaßen stärker sind als das Problem, das uns da ökonomisch begegnen kann"", sagte Scholz. Die Herausforderungen seien gewaltig. ""Diese Krise betrifft uns alle."" Scholz betonte: ""Deshalb wird hier nicht gekleckert, es wird geklotzt.""

Die Coronaviruskrise belastet viele Branchen massiv. Messen und Veranstaltungen werden abgesagt, Reisen storniert. Zugleich geht die Nachfrage aus dem Ausland zurück und internationale Lieferketten werden gestört, was sich auf die Produktion in Deutschland auswirkt. Viele Ökonomen gehen inzwischen davon aus, dass Deutschland in die Rezession rutscht. Nach Einschätzung der EU-Kommission wird die Wirtschaft in der Europäischen Union in diesem Jahr schrumpfen.

Das Hilfspaket der Bundesregierung sieht vor, dass Firmen zum einen die Möglichkeit von Steuerstundungen in Milliardenhöhe gewährt werden soll - mit dem Ziel, die Liquidität zu verbessern. Außerdem soll es ""im Volumen unbegrenzte"" Maßnahmen zur Liquiditätsausstattung geben, wie aus einem Papier hervorgeht. Wegen der hohen Unsicherheit in der jetzigen Lage sei bewusst auf eine Begrenzung verzichtet worden.

Bestehende Kreditprogramme sollen ausgeweitet werden - damit Firmen günstige Kredite bekommen. Bedingungen dafür sollen gelockert werden. Eine zentrale Rolle spielt die Staatsbank KfW. Daneben wird der Zugang zu Bürgschaften erheblich erleichtert.

Für Firmen, die krisenbedingt vorübergehend in ernsthafte Finanzierungsprobleme geraten und daher nicht ohne weiteres Zugang zu bestehenden Förderprogrammen haben, soll es zusätzliche Sonderprogramme geben. Die Regierung werde die KfW in die Lage versetzen, die Programme entsprechend auszustatten - indem die notwendigen Garantievolumina zur Verfügung gestellt werden. Im Haushalt stehe bisher ein Garantierahmen von 460 Milliarden Euro zur Verfügung, der nun um bis zu 93 Milliarden Euro erhöht werden kann.

Scholz machte aber klar, dass dies nicht das Ende der Fahnenstange sei. Weitere Volumina könnten im Notfall vom Haushaltsausschuss des Bundestags genehmigt werden. Die Sonderprogramme werden nun laut Papier bei der EU-Kommission zur Genehmigung angemeldet. Brüssel muss wegen beihilferechtlicher Fragen zustimmen.

Spitzenverbände der Wirtschaft begrüßten die Maßnahmen vor einem am Freitagabend geplanten Spitzentreffen mit Gewerkschaften und Kanzlerin Angela Merkel . So sagte DIHK-Präsident Eric Schweitzer: ""Das Gesamtpaket ist ein wichtiges Signal, das die deutschen Unternehmen jetzt brauchen."" Die deutsche Wirtschaft erhalte dadurch eine Chance, besser durch diese ""extreme Krise"" zu kommen.

""Das ist die Bazooka, mit der wir das Notwendige jetzt tun"", sagte Scholz. Der Begriff ""Bazooka"" stammt aus der Staatsschuldenkrise und bezog sich auf die Europäische Zentralbank, die damals mit quasi ""unbegrenzter Feuerkraft"" die Krise eingedämmt hatte.

EZB-Präsident Mario Draghi hatte im Sommer 2012 auf dem Höhepunkt der Euroschuldenkrise die Eurozone außerdem mit dem Versprechen stabilisiert, ""die EZB wird alles tun, um den Euro zu retten"" (""Whatever it takes""). ""Das ist ein ""Whatever it takes"" der Bundesregierung"", sagte der Chefvolkswirt der DekaBank, Ulrich Kater, zu den Ankündigungen am Freitag. Dies sei genau die Nachricht, die die Abwärtsspirale der Erwartungen durchbrechen könne.

Der Auftritt von Scholz und Altmaier erinnerte außerdem an das Versprechen von Kanzlerin Merkel und dem damaligen Finanzminister Peer Steinbrück (SPD) auf dem Höhepunkt der Finanzkrise 2008, als beide gemeinsam den Sparern versicherten, die Einlagen seien sicher. Angesprochen auf Vergleiche mit den Auftritten von Merkel und Steinbrück sowie Draghi sagte Scholz: ""Wir machen unsere Arbeit.""

Neben den Kreditprogrammen für Firmen sollen Beschäftigte in der Coronaviruskrise außerdem durch öffentlich finanziertes Kurzarbeitergeld vor Arbeitslosigkeit geschützt werden. Der Bundestag beschloss am Freitag in einem beispiellosen Schnellverfahren einstimmig einen Gesetzentwurf für erleichtertes Kurzarbeitergeld. Nach der Verabschiedung im Bundestag passierte er am Freitag auch den Bundesrat. Mehr Unternehmen als bisher sollen die Leistung der Bundesagentur für Arbeit (BA) ab April beantragen können. Die Sozialbeiträge sollen ihnen zudem voll von der BA erstattet werden.

Die Bundesregierung schloss außerdem weitergehende Hilfen nicht aus. So könnten Konjunkturprogramme aufgelegt werden, falls nötig, sagte Scholz. Doch jetzt könne ein Programm, das dazu führt, dass die Menschen hinausgehen, aus gesundheitlichen Gründen gerade das Falsche sein. Deswegen seien die beschlossenen Kreditzusagen für Unternehmen derzeit zunächst das Richtige. Maßnahmen wie ein Vorziehen der Soli-Teilabschaffung aber seien nicht vom Tisch.

Altmaier sagte: ""Wir sind heute der Auffassung, dass es richtig war, jetzt diesen Schritt zu tun, damit die nötigsten und drängendsten Probleme der Unternehmen gelöst werden."" Die weitere Entwicklung werde aber beobachtet, weitere Maßnahmen würden ergriffen, wenn es dafür der richtige Zeitpunkt sei. Der Wirtschaftsminister hatte einen Drei-Stufen-Plan vorgelegt - erreicht ist nun Stufe zwei. Stufe drei wären Konjunkturprogramme in großem Stil.

Scholz betonte, angesichts der guten Haushaltslage könne der Staat das tun, ""was jetzt notwendig ist"". Der Bund hatte in den vergangenen Jahren angesichts der guten Wirtschaftslage und sprudelnder Steuereinnahmen Milliardenüberschüsse erzielt. Der Finanzminister deutete aber an, dass sich der Bund für die Hilfsprogramme verschulden muss - und damit den jahrelangen Kurs der ""schwarzen Null"" aufgibt, einer Politik ohne Neuverschuldung . Scholz sagte, es sei nicht unplausibel, dass es nun zusätzlichen Geldbedarf gebe. ""Man darf einer Krise nicht hinterhersparen"". Die Krise bleibe nicht ohne Folgen für Ausgaben und Einnahmen. Scholz will nächste Woche Eckpunkte für den Bundeshaushalt 2021 vorlegen.

Der Finanzminister betonte auch die Bedeutung eines gemeinsamen Vorgehens in der EU, die nun eine ""Schicksalsgemeinschaft"" sei. Die EU-Kommission kündigte an, im Falle eines Wirtschaftseinbruchs wegen der Coronaviruskrise die europäischen Fiskalregeln auszusetzen./vsr/bw/hoe/sam/DP/nas",https://web.archive.org/web/20200314153511id_/https://www.boerse-online.de/nachrichten/aktien/virus-roundup-bazooka-gegen-corona-regierung-errichtet-riesen-schutzschild-1028994525,,,

Gov. Jay Inslee says that the public still needs to be prepared for the state's current two-week stay-at-home order to be extended.



By GENE JOHNSON and RACHEL LA CORTE

Associated Press

SEATTLE — Public health officials and researchers said Monday social distancing appears to be helping slow the spread of COVID-19 in the Seattle area, where many of the first U.S. deaths occurred, but Washington Gov. Jay Inslee says that the public still needs to be prepared for the state's current two-week stay-at-home order to be extended.

Dr. Jeff Duchin, the public health officer for Seattle and King County, said a new analysis by the Bellevue-based Institute of Disease Modeling provides a powerful indication that the region needs to double down on the policies it's already adopted.

“What we're doing now appears to be working,” Duchin said. “We need to continue this for weeks.”

Inslee issued a stay-at-home order last week that is in effect through April 6, and ordered all non-essential businesses to close through at least April 8. The latest orders expanded previous actions taken by Inslee that ordered the statewide closure of bars, dine-in restaurants, and entertainment and recreation facilities and banned large gatherings. The state released a website Monday where people can report violations of non-essential businesses operating. Inslee said residents should not call 911 to report individuals or private group who are not following the proclamation, but should instead contact local law enforcement.

Inslee said that while no final decision has been made on extending the order, “it is very highly likely that there will be some further measures.”

“While we may have had some success in some parts of our state to some degree, a modest degree of bending the curve down of the rate of acceleration of the virus, we have some disturbing news in other places in the state,” he said, citing some counties, including Skagit, Adams and Island, where the percentage of tests that came back positive this week were two to three times higher than positive results in the previous week.

“It is very alarming to us, and indicates that we have to refocus our attention, redouble our efforts and stay on top of this effort,” Inslee said.

In two papers released Monday, the Institute for Disease Modeling acknowledged that much remains unknown about rates of infection, but based on available data and a variety of assumptions, its computer models suggest that a measure of transmission — an estimate of how many people are infected by each person who is already infected — has fallen. In late February, each person with COVID was infecting about 2.7 other people; by March 18, that number had dropped to 1.4, the researchers found.

They cautioned that the numbers were rough estimates; Duchin said he felt confident saying the rate of transmission is lower than it was, but he wouldn't put much stock in the precise figure. To see a drop in the number of new cases, the measure of transmission would have to be below 1.

“The main takeaway here is though we've made some great headway, our progress is precarious and insufficient,” said Dr. Daniel Klein, computational team lead at the institute.

The institute also relied on anonymized Facebook data to show that people in the region have been reducing their travel in the past month, spending less time in commercial and mixed-use zones and more time in single- and multifamily residential zones.

The Institute for Disease Modeling part of the Global Good Fund, a collaboration between Intellectual Ventures and Bill and Melinda Gates. It is contributing its services to state and local governments to assist in their response to the outbreak.

“The data in the Institute for Disease Modeling report offer much needed hope that we are making progress against this pandemic, and that our strong physical distancing policies are having their intended effect of keeping people healthy,” King County Executive Dow Constantine said in a written statement.

More than 65,000 people have been tested for coronavirus in Washington, according to the state Department of Health. More than 4,800 have tested positive and at least 195 people have died.

For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in several weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death.
